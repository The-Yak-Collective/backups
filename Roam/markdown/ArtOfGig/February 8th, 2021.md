- #[[Year 1 meeting notes]] Regular Yak Rover group meeting No:3 (10 PM Pacific, morning in Europe, afternoon in Japan).
- Contents & Agenda (planned)
    - Quick overview of PLEXIL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLEXIL
        - PLEXIL is a framework developed at NASA, used on many missions to define the behaviour of "agents" (rover, satellites, smart habitats).
        - Since 2006, open source: https://sourceforge.net/p/plexil/.
        - Group questions
            - Is it an attractive candidate for the Yak Stack?
            - What can we learn for rovers?
    - Hardware at the "Spider Yak Mini Lab", aka rover Z1 environment.
        - Goals:
            - A toolkit for remote/autonomous operations, evaluation, measurements and telemetry.
            - Learning by doing: An attempt at a blueprint, and a bit of reinventing the wheels.
            - Output should be reusable software.
        - A dedicated corner of the room for a rover (about ~1m2, ~3ft2).
        - Tethered spider bot from HiWonder (computer a Raspberry Pi 4, full Linux).
        - SSH access to the team.
        - Video stream and snapshots from the bot front camera. E.g. snapshots: http://153.127.64.244:3537/?action=snapshot (please use little, weak bot :-|)
        - Thermal imaging of the bot from atop.
        - Roadmap for the quarter:
            - More remote operations, shared usage facilities, more telemetry.
            - New sensors, and measurements: OAK-1 camera, ultrasonic proximity, 1D LIDAR.
            - More landmarks.
        - Group questions:
            - Imagine you have the rover of your dreams. How do you ideally interact with it?
- Minutes
    - Standups: Did, Next, Blockers. 
        - 
    - TODO
