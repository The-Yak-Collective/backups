- Basic OnShape commands you should know
    - Mac
        - 2-finger click and drag to rotate
        - Ctrl-2-finger drag to pan
        - Two finger pinch and unpinch to zoom
        - Click to select/deselect areas of drawings for extrusion, deletion, etc.
    - PC
        - dunno??
- Triage approach
    - Identify major fasteners or dependent dimensions (screw holes for eg)
    - Start with a quick and dirty isometric sketch

    - Open a new document
    - Set the workspace units 
    - Start a new sketch, preferably on the Top plane
    - Right click and "view normal to sketch plane"
    - Make the basic outline and do an extrusion
    - Then pick surfaces to work with, and keep defining new sketches and extrusions
    - For 3d printing, use negative extrusions for holes, not the hole feature, which will have annoying crap for drilled holes
