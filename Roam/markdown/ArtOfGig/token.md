- [[**Yak Coins**]] experiment w/ google form + zapier to discord #yakcoin-log + keep track of your own balance   https://forms.gle/CDK454BWxC9xnpQK9
- design ideas/principles
    - balance out gamification incentive/disincentives
        - Internal only?

        - non-[[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]] perhaps
    - two tiers?
        - social currency vs transactional currency

        - "One thought I had was that every voice chat mines coins in proportion to the number of people who attended, so 5 people in a 10 minute chat = 5 yak coins mined for eg. It's a proxy for growth in trust levels and takes actually non-fake participation to create. Similarly for collaborative output. 25 people contributing 2 slides each to a deck = say 50 yakcoins create" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - technology expressions:
        - [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]
            - [[Aragon]] / dandelion organization 
            - if going the blockchain wrote, I [[Greg Docter]] can see what ConsenSys folks might have to offer here (either in terms of insight or tooling itself)
        - physical yak coin
            - coming back to the idea of a physical yak coin, still interested? I'd happy foot the bill for the first run of 100 if we can get to a design that's yak-approved

            - challenge coins
