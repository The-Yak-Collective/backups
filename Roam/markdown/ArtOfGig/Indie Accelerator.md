- About:: __ Study track with the goal of speeding up an indies first few months/years as an Indie Consultant. As an organization still in incubation (founded Jan 2023), we are still trying to define how to achieve this goal. [[Yak Collective]] has a depth of domain knowledge so we think we are well-positioned to support each other in this journey. 
- Chief Page Wrangler:: [[Kiran Pathakota]]
    - Additional Page Wranglers:: [[Grigori Milov]] | [[Fname Lname]]

    - We are currently in study group mode but looking to supplement this with [[indie coffee chats]] and occasional workshops.

- Workshops in production: 
    - Revamp of [[Pilot Workshop â€“ Executive Sparring]]
        - Goal is to record it this time. Potentially make it possible to train others in the future.

    - Online footprint evals
        - **Description:** Kind of like SEO optimization but for indie consultants. Go through personal website, linkedin, twitter etc. and provide help and support for improving a particular aspect of the yak's footprint.

        - Notes: 
            - Maier:
                - What type of Indie are we talking about here? 
                - Consulting is a process not a phase diagram
                - Equity that a consultant builds
                    - Connections, skills.
            - Rinku: 
                - Not sure exactly what to do BUT knows it's not about working at a large company. 
                - Worried about: 
                    - Consultants still work for people.
            - Jenna: 
                - Has anchor clients. No reason to bail even though it might be the *wrong* way. 
                - Using #[[Indie Accelerator]] as a potential for a reboot.

            - Drew:
                - Different problem. 
                - Leg of sales is the hardest. Going from the connection -> sale is tough. 
            - Gbenga: 
                - What are good strategies to find common ground and make networking less taxing. 
            - Shreeda
                - Perhaps YC could help with circling. Do the reading, discussion and then a circling session? 
                    - Circling: Ideas to help one person through a case study. 
            - 
            - Ideas: 
                - Personal website audit/design? 
            - Next steps: 
                - Perma-post for intros
                - Add a book list to this group.

            - 
        - Jenna
            - Car loan (modern economy is actually unsuitable for indies)
            - How do we collaborate together? Tough to move money around and sharing the fruits of the labor together.
