- About:: __ Study track with the goal of speeding up an indies first few months/years as an Indie Consultant. As an organization still in incubation (founded Jan 2023), we are still trying to define how to achieve this goal. [[Yak Collective]] has a depth of domain knowledge so we think folks should be in good hands.

        - Notes: 
            - Maier:
                - What type of Indie are we talking about here? 
                - Consulting is a process not a phase diagram
                - Equity that a consultant builds
                    - Connections, skills.
            - Rinku: 
                - Not sure exactly what to do BUT knows it's not about working at a large company. 
                - Worried about: 
                    - Consultants still work for people.
            - Jenna: 
                - Has anchor clients. No reason to bail even though it might be the *wrong* way. 
                - Using #[[Indie Accelerator]] as a potential for a reboot.
