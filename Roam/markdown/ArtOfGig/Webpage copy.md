Prompt School is an initiative of the Yak Collective to develop ultra-lightweight learning infrastructure. It comprises a set of workshop tracks around various topics Yak Collective members are interested in learning.
The goal of Prompt School is to give Yak Collective members an easy way to form collaborative peer-learning study groups to learn about a topic of mutual interest with some minimal helpful structure. 
# How It Works
Each track is built around weekly prompts, such as posting a comment on a selected reading or a 15-minute hands-on exercise, that participants can do on their own time. There are no live calls, just text chat in a Discord channel. You just join the Yak Collective discord, go to the channel for the workshop track that interests you, and type `/promptrecall`.
That will show the current prompt, and you can just do it. That's it! Every week, the curator will add a new prompt. Old prompts are archived on a shared Roam page.
    - TO BE ADDED LATER: Instruction for adding a prompt response
Right now, the prompt bot is primitive, but we have plans to develop it into a sophisticated learning assistant to help you work through the archive of prompts at your own pace, maintain a log of completed prompts, and your current position, and so on.
Prompt writing is a skill, and workshop participants should plan on providing feedback about how useful/clear they found the prompt using the reaction emoji provided by `/promptrecall`.
# Current Workshop Tracks
Currently, there are 4 active workshop tracks
    - [[Astonishing Workshop]], curated by Sachin Benny: In this workshop we try to develop our storytelling skills by reading a skills-related article each week, and doing some sort of short related skill-building exercise.
    - [[AI Workshop]], curated by Venkatesh Rao: In this workshop, we aim to keep up with state of the art in machine learning and AI. We aim for a lightweight technical level, and prompts usually relate to reading a good article or paper, trying out some low code/no code tool, or doing very simple math to understand important concepts.
    - [[Terraforming Workshop]], curated by Patrick Atwater: seventy two years into the start of the anthropocene, humanity's has the opportunity and indeed urgency to embrace planetary scale stewardship. In this workshop we examine the latest climate science to understand the future impacts and explore bold large scale designed interventions to ensure a human habitable biosphere. Prompts usually involve reading and responding to a moderately technical paper with occasional playing around with models. 
    - [[Fermi Gym]], curated by the participants taking turns: In this workshop, we aim to practice and improve our skills at Fermi estimation, the art of using basic science knowledge and simple arithmetic to find approximate answers to interesting questions. Examples: What is the weight of the earth? How tall can a mountain get? How much battery storage would be required to transition from fossil fuels?
# Interested in Developing Your Own Workshop?
If you're interested in developing and curating a workshop, all you need to do is propose it in our #proposal-log channel, and if it gets 4 votes, you can kick it off. In our experience so far, you only need a couple of people and a few weeks worth of ideas for prompts to get going and make it rewarding. We suggest participating in an existing workshop for a while first, to see how it is done, and talking to a curator of an existing track.
If interest and critical mass develops, a prompt school track may turn into a discussion group built around a weekly live call (such as our online governance and blockchain groups) or a long-term collaborative project (such as our Yak Rover project)
