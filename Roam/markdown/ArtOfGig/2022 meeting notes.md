        - **Rover** OS
            - Diversity, low volume for a given "kind" (e.g. rover)
            - Need the right metaphores
            - What is a rover? How to qualify?
                - Last time we talked about it: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/kZRPqFN4E
        - Is ROS an OS?
            - OS often about scheduling and other resource management. ROS has none.
            - Parallel with Linux distributions
            - Does it provide the "right" abstraction level?
            - No default user interface (e.g. shell for Linux, Finder for MacOS)
            - It did not live up to the label of "OS", based on our reviews
                - Marginal extras compared to directly using, say, Linux or maker libraries (e.g. Beaglebone's)
                - Gets in the way
        - Hello World of an OS
            - `ls` kind of command, to start feeling the concept (here centered on the file system), see the list of sensors/actuators, etc
            - Typical sample program on Arduino, etc is the LED blinking---safe and simple.
            - As an operator, expecting the same basic experience (e.g. shell + `ls` / operating systems navigation commands)
            - Deploy on N bots should not give very different basic experience
            - Possible `ls` to detail the orientation from the viewpoint of the rover
        - Need for an "interface" (also "user interface")
        - Perspective from Asimov's 3 laws
            - Protect humans
            - Protect others from harm
            - Protect yourself
        - Nvidia Isaac https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/
            - Never say OS, but platform
            - Jetson penetration (see Jascha Feb 1st), Isaac on software
        - Perhaps a strong approach is "identity system" (self, body boundaries, safety)
        - Contemporary problems:
            - Multi-robot / multi-agent systems (air traffic control, fleet monitoring)
                - Where is the boundary? 1 robot, 1 fleet?
                - ROS makes communication easy, but nothing on what to do (e.g. protocols)
                    - Now to get fleet controller, basically need a "server"
                    - Problem of decentralization
                - Old problems, but now getting out there
                - Perhaps time to (re)approach?
                    - Extensive academic research since the 90s
                    - Problems of cost: Now cheaper to make actual multi-robots
            - Decentralization, place of blockchain technologies?
    - January 18th, 2022 UTC: Maier on extended OS discussion ~~Licensing~~
        - Continuing discussion on OS after [last week](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/1Pa3V1k_u).
        - Licensing will be discussed later in the cycle.
        - No update on WWG at this point.

        - Update on "Mars Garden"
            - By Mission Control Space Services Inc
                - A "garden" made and available
                - Indoor lunar analogue testbed, usable on demand.
                - Provides map with different conditions (impressive different lightning depending on region)
            - Canadian Space Agency "Mars yard"
            - European Rover Challenge

        - BOS ideas and discussion points
            - Discussion on scope
                - BOS would see Linux same as a BIOS
                - 
            - Issue of defining safety (software and physical)
            - Rover "activities" different from "missions"
                - "OS scheduling" becomes a different mechanism
                - Activities map to set of OS processes, but for applications.
                - BOS processes (provided by the system to applications) are not activities in this terminology
            - System services
                - Location, state, etc?
                - Autonomy as a service???
                    - Question on "autonomy"
                    - Discussion on practical subsets, like energy management.
                - Criteria: Do they affect the state of the rover, or can be isolated?
            - Parallel with Linux kernel
                - Kernel provides two categories of operations, user space and system
                - Activity are affordances provided by actuators
                - Actuator as potential central part. Or closed-loops?
            - Metaphors
                - Butler?
                - Field agent/spy?
                - "Economy of activities", like how economies lead some activities to work (e.g. what I do outside the US cannot impact directly the US economy)
        - Draft on possible boot-up procedure
            - Text document with list of things to do on booting up
            - Including security (with blockchain), integrity, safety, services
            - Autonomic aspects
            - Note for later -- crash-only systems that only startup once and never shut down except by crashing
    - January 25th, 2022 5:45 UTC: Anuraj on "Getting Started with Rovers"
        - how to start robotics with any budget and any skill
        - not keeping notes of anything in slide set
        - slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtmmXSZlU4JE1ruOgW-zZdgYQ9E_5K78ShbMAxCR-70/edit#slide=id.g1037a92bb10_0_484
        - programming language for gazebo - python, c++, can add RPC and use that to set it up as a ROS node
        - coppelia is short runway and high ceiling
        - printed robots - esa-  take 3-4 weeks, of which 3-4 are full 24h/day printing. if done only weekends, a few months. expect to make some mistakes so it takes longer
        - esa robot needs a specific size printer to fit the parts. price for minimal printer is always going down
        - printing ottodiy takes about 24h printing
        - @vgr - printing an existing design has lots of overhead - mistakes, fiting together, assembly, fiting in electronics. figure x5 of printing time for assembly and another x10 for software
        - people can be build esa in 1-2 months because esa spent 2-3 years building it
        - vgr self build - parts cost about comp $110 electronics $70 wiring $70 battery $10.  so about $200-300. but actually spent $400-500 - due to breaking things.
        - validated design can save money and time!
        - @brian simulators - do you need to build your own robot in simulator or do they come ready?
            - @Anuraj - gazebo - you can import most parts. also you can model only joints and outside shell and overload an image/model on it
            - coppelia has predefined models. also has its own youtube channel. simulations are crowdsourced too.
        - @brian - where do you get the electronics for the esa?
            - esa has a shop on amazon - bought it all there. many parts are unique and specific dimensions- to match the size of build you use.
                - uses raspberry pi computer
            - ottodiy has two modes - one where you buy it all and one where you buy only electronics
        - @rhett - what about build systems, like lego mindstorms - now lego nxt
        - vgr - we should make a sensor/actuator kit and all other parts would be printed/open source like raspberry pi
        - brian - https://www.vexrobotics.com/
        - maier - mindstorms seems uninviting - difficult to make changes
            - vgr - mechanics closed universe was uninspiring. new things like monster truck parts seems more inviting - you have same scene but more flexibility. though it is merely remote control toys. better inspiration loop because you can build your own, buy more, etc.
            - lego now has an open build community
            - one company controlling a  series of kits is dispiriting
            - fabian  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwHHErfX9hI - experiments. shows something about challenges for a rover
        - anuraj - starting? start with ottodiy, programmable in scratch, c++, arudino, etc.
            - shoudl take 1 month of weekeneds to get it to walk
            - 3 montsh avoiding thigs - playing with visual blcoks, using example sfrom online
            - a few months more to add parts or use ottoninja 
        - maier - can we/should we sell a branded version of otto?
            - anuraj - start by building a model for importing into simulators
            - this can be a starter kit.
        - vgr - we should revisit this subject periodically - it is fast moving space of entry level robotics

        - Exploring build systems, in general, not only traditional `Makefile` like approaches, but also the HW side of "building".
            - "Build system" is typical of software engineering (process to transform source code into machine code, etc)
            - Rovers are varied in SW and HW.
        - "Stubborn Pursuit of a Path" is a build to explore minimalist approach.

        - Model rocketry: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16lQUPcu_2r3BXMnx4Tt6xA8aKtf-_HsboTQ6HYXPHNs/edit?usp=sharing
        - "To do model rocketry, you need a rocket"
        - One goal it to go higher.
        - Tradeoffs
            - Depending on the form factor
            - Heavier rockets usually need a lot of thrust at the beginning, etc.
            - Thrust duration competes with impulse.
            - Complexity levels, e.g. several engines can require extra work to synchronize.
        - Associations like NAR and Tripoli
            - Fun time
            - Competitions
            - Community
        - Certification
            - Not needed for small rockets (function of impulse and capacity).
            - Needed for builds qualified as "high power" (3 levels).
            - Need specific locations depending on power.
            - Buying high power models requires certification.
        - Simulation and design software: To help in making custom builds.
            - Custom builds can be dangerous
            - Some basic criteria calculated by tools: Center of gravity must be "behind" the center of pressure.
        - Passive/active control
            - Active is sometimes forbidden, dangerous, closer to weaponry.
            - Aim to stabilize
            - Sometimes to guide too
        - Serious commitment leads to rocket fuel
            - Usually simple black powder
            - More efficient with ammonium perchlorate and hybrid fuel (liquid+solid components)
        - Interest for rovers
            - Testing launches for a given weight and form factor? Maybe, but difficult and best delegated. Perhaps still valid just for the very first moments of launch, before entering more heavy-weight testing.
            - Testing landing looks much more valuable and feasible.

        - Faster Mini Cheetah
            - https://www.popsci.com/technology/machine-learning-robot-runs-its-fastest/
            - "robots that could cross any kind of topography were generally sluggish across the board, because they weren’t optimized for speed; their responses were challenging to program."
            - "researchers’ workaround was to use reinforcement learning"
            - "the team simulated all the potential scenarios of the real-world in a computer."
            - "it could modify how it loped in real time to adapt to the conditions of its route"
            - "Thanks to this machine learning software, Mini Cheetah bumped its peak indoor velocity from 12 feet per second before training to 13 feet per second after. It more or less maintained this speed outdoors when tearing up unfamiliar grounds. It could catch itself when it tripped. Even if it had a broken leg, it could find a way to hobble on at maximum speed.""

    - March 29th - Straw-man synthesis (architecture) and action items for field testing
        - Today at the YR meeting, aware of 3 view on collaborating for the end of year demo. 3 "strawmen"
            - Venkat's inter agent protocol, where agents are rovers, non-roving robots and humans.
            - Rhett's bottom up proposal to leverage practical technologies, ground for actually completing something by demo day.
            - The above link, which focuses on software architecture to accommodate a few aspects we have been talking about.

What is surprisingly interesting is the complementary of the views: Inter agent, intra agent, and mapping to real tech.
        - Venkatesh on "inter agent protocol"
            - Inspired by the games/missions we have in mind
            - 3 kinds of agents: Robots, base stations/satellites, humans
            - The more rovers get intelligent, the more we should be able to trust them on many topics (e.g. comm with Earth)
            - Some abstraction level: All agents "equals" in terms of protocol.
            - Need for shared semantics, in the messaging protocol
            - "Mimetic transmission" in the protocol
            - Properties
                - Evolving based on actual collective experience
                - Autonomy, collective construction and adaptation
                - Kind of economy of language
                - Invented language/protocol
            - Proposal: Suggestion for a simple scenario first
                - Define a first reduced vocabulary for this year
                - Basic broadcasting, etc.
            - Questions:
                - What is language evolution, in more concrete detail? Semantics and/or grammar? E.g. what concept to learn, which ones are useful? Limited memory, etc.
                    - "Community of practice" help here.
                    - Let multiple meaning compete and find the fittest.
                - What mechanism to make sure concepts are useful and should be kept?
                - What kind of change can be made to the language to make it useful?
                - Protocol is about RPC or "goal driven" declarative messages?
                    - RPC is planning and send commands
                    - Declarative is set the goal and let the target split into commands by itself
                    - Maybe need both
        - Rhett on a bottom-up view of a software stack
            - https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakrover/pull/3
            - Capitalise on Viktor's work with VPN for connectivity
            - Base API for all rovers
                - Identification
                - "Command injection" a la NASA
                - Camera
                - Metrics
            - Minimal API could just be identification and CI
            - Demo idea
                - 2 rovers come to the same object. They have to agree it is the same object. They have to identify each other. Pick up the object together.

        - Materials: https://www.figma.com/file/txEcKRHklPWdE0BdkVBGOo/The-Strawman?node-id=0%3A1
        - Goals
            - Identify action items on software collaboration
            - Short list of scenarios for Demo Day
        - Questions
            - Time matters?
            - Precision hard to guarantee across builds
            - All depend on the application and architecture
            - Confusing wording like API, usually understood as "Rest API", but actually meaning the "classical" programming interface (as in design by contract, or to some extent Java's interface or Objective-C protocols, etc)
            - Comms in Victor's work hit the "API" directly, allowing for direct remote control. So comms can bypass the controller. In here, comms are not supposed to bypass the controller. Control takes in comms as input to its "decision"/logics. Also Victor's comms are seen as optional, yet missing from the original figure (now added). Indeed we want sometimes for a remote controller (either human or programmed) to assume control, e.g. navigate locally to examine some area, while the main controller goal is still to go to some target).

            - Shared minimal command vocabulary
                - "Go forward" might be 2 feet or 20 feet in different universes
                - Forward, backward, turn, take photo (send photo to global)
                - Swarm commands: "* turn right"

        - Abstract: The modeling of very complex problems requires the participation of people
with diverse backgrounds. The combined eorts of these people, properly coordinated,
can contribute to the solution of complex problems, but only if we facilitate the process
of communicating. In this paper, we highlight the importance of languages, illustrated
by a discussion of the \languages" used by four core groups of people. We show how
the choice of language can either disguise similarities or hide important dierences.
Most signicantly, we illustrate how the language we speak can color our view of the
problem, leading, in some cases, to poor representations of a problem.

            - Jascha -- advising 2 companies, more IoT
            - Ian -- bought a crawler and DJI drone
            - Rhett -- might have felt more successful if no goals :D

            - maier: 
                - what worked: supporting brian, youtube, keeping project going, learning community aspect worked
                - what didn't work: working together, stimulating each other to make progress, unable to decide what it is we're doing... individual fun? group fun? standout project to show others??
            - anuraj
                - what worked: consistency, regular meetings working out, beginnings of a common project, controlling hardware over the internet
                - what's not working: converging/working together more, more exhaust... website etc
            - erik
                - unusual year personally...
                - moved more towards software (good? bad?)
                - what worked: self-reorg when PM vanished :D... maturity/interest of all members
                - what didn't work: first quarter discussion on common target just collapsed
            - Jascha
                - Unable to join for professional/personal, so little to say
                - Convergence?
                - Work in remote teams: Usually common infrastructure in the background. Do we have one? An always online rover with charging dock, always available to the team.
                - Could foster joint work
            - Brian
                - Working: Group dynamics, learning space.
                - Not worked: A common project to join and contribute to would be great.
            - Rhett
                - Working: Meetings still attractive, especially unplanned ones. Satisfied with a project to keep tinkering on.
                - Surprised: Little discussion about shared worked (notably links on Discord); lack of (natural) collaboration; common infrastructure would be great and encourage collaboration.
            - Ian
                - Ability to "clone" a rover (BOM, etc) would help. A "reverse infrastructure" to reproduce easily and foster collaboration.
                - Right now too many options, hard to see any baseline.
            - Closing remark, Venkat
                - Desire for some satisfying common project
                - Something like a 1 child 1 computer?
                - Can we pick a goal better aligned to who we are?

                    - Hole punching is that opening a connection between two bubbles, which would let arbitrary communications come through, without network level control (bypassing a network guards like firewalls).
                    - Annoying as many blocks not playing well, mainly for security reasons (protecting an internal network, etc).
                    - Mainly an IPv4 problem. In IPv6 gives one unique address for every device, so often no need for NAT. But IPv6 not really available
                - Pain points to do networking because of these legacy infrastructure
                - Problem of networking patterns: Traffic goes through bottlenecks and centralised infrastructure points, even if trying to contact our physical neighbour (different from an "internet neighbour" in general)
                - How do we hole punch in a secure but smoother ways? Like on  a VPN.
                    - With VPN, need for setting an extra server.
                    - Alternative exists, like Tailscale or Zerotier
            - What is VPN ? Trad home network with cat5 cables?
                - 1 address for the whole home network
                - Hub/switch etc routing to all devices
                - VPN on top to connect several networks seen as secured unit from "outside": 2 addresses (public and private)
                - Ability to communicate both ways (e.g. browser <-> server)
                - Basically centralised model for the home network.
                - Need to configure and maintain (notably rotate keys regularly)
            - Tailscale peer to peer VPN network
                - Infrastructure to just deal with keys, the rest is P2P
                - Hole punch automation
                - More flexible than VPN
                - Security becomes simpler for the users
                - Software defined network
            - ngrok
                - Difficult random URLs for each network node/endpoint/service
                - Especially valid when short-lived nodes
            - Questions
                - Last year demo day was simpler, using dynamic DNS to get to each bot.
                - Can Tailscale work on MCUs? Need for minimum kernel pieces (typically networking stacks).
                - Tradeoffs
                    - Harder to centralise shared pieces of infrastructure
                    - Hole punching (basically comm with anyone) made easy
                    - Reconcile physical (e.g. a rover) and virtual (IP address)
                - What would be the minimal viable virtual and consistent "world" -> topic for next week
        - Do we have enough to do an annual event?
        - Pivot/retool/reboot ideas?
            - Oceanic?
            - Loosen Mars Mission thing?
            - Distributed design engineering?
            - "Robot focused tailscale" ????
    - Nov 22:
        - Simulated rover
            - Allow software coordination
        - Levels of "simulation"
            - soft rover, RPi with camera, gimballed Rpi, rover
        - Rhett demo
            - VM connected to VPN tailscale
            - Can do the same thing over zerotier... next expt
        - Tailscale vs. Zerotier
            - Venn diagram intersection of individual tailents vs. one owner owns all the circles
            - House party vs. park party
            - Individual node security happens at node level
            - How do you handle failover for coordination servers?
        - Interaction with external identities like github repo access
        - These are the only 2 known solutions at consumer grade
        - Zerotier public network option... option to go blockchainy
            - Some link to urbit? (as in, it looks like there is some urbit lying under?)
        - Vs. Victor VPN
            - No need to maintain server
            - Robust, easy on/off
            - These systems skip dns
        - Minimum-viable experiment??
    - Nov. 29
        - Follow up after last week on VPN-related technologies
        - Rhett: Rover Stack
            - Tier 0: Collaboration Infrastructure (People)
                - Discord, GitHub, VPNs
            - Tier 1: APIs for Rovers
                - Could be direct commands (e.g. Rhett's language),
                - Or "higher level" layer
                    - Facilities around and extensions to command APIs
                    - Timeline of desired commands
                    - Predictions of what the command timeline leads to (body and situation)
                    - Time sharing
                    - Abstraction of the actual rover (more than with direct commands?)
                    - Companies using predictions for telepresence / "remote controls" (or used at some point)
                        - Telexistence https://tx-inc.com/en/home/
                        - S4E https://www.linkedin.com/company/se4/ (went under, so website lost)
            - Tier 2: Apps
        - APIs for many similar rovers (all Wall-Es) or different ones (1 super Wall-E with a lot of compute)
        - Needs for publishing capabilities
        - Perhaps interesting to split tiers into user side and rover side.
        - Next week on Tier 0
            - Working example with Rhett, Jascha and Maier.
            - Look into Nvidia Omniverse or Unity?
    - Dec. 7th
        - On collaborative infrastructure
        - Demo with TailScale on a RPi-based rover.
            - Step by step review and discussion.
            - Install TailScale with apt, link to a TailScale account, communicate.
            - Less than 5 min to attach the rover to an account.
            - Problem of naming conflict, and words like "spider" and "bot" seem forbidden.
            - Adding the email address to the "group:yak" in  "Access controls" tab on TailScale allows to SSH into the newly-linked rover from anywhere.
            - Demo pinging from the new rover to an existing one and back.
            - On the network, the `yak-prime` machine exposes endpoints. Demo to access them from the new rover (metrics, cam capture).
            - Questions
                - Can we link a machine to several TailScale networks?
                    - Apparently yes since last week
                    - 2 nets at the same time.
                - Each node has an owner associated. This can be replaced by tags. Owned nodes are "servers" (personal devices, so only the owner can SSH), tagged nodes are "clients" (everyone with permission can access through the tags). Tags are shared infrastructure.
                - What is the Yak Rover project aiming at in terms of network?
        - About changing the project to a study group on robotics, and rover as one topic
            - Idea to breakdown into more focused topics. Typically like the one on networking the past few sessions. Others like ML, etc.
            - Issue of creating islands.
            - Potential to expose clearer topics that people can related to and join.
            - Similar to what OpenRobotics is doing. But having a single mission is important toward a concrete goal.
        - Next week on simulation, Jascha and Eric (something about Gazebo, Unity, Isaac?)
    - Dec. 14th
        - On simulators
        - Goals of simulation
            - Photo-realistic simulations for show/demo
            - Doing Science and ML when good physics engine
            - Possible world reviews (e.g. a full space mission)
            - Robot application development
            - Breaking time constraints (science, review, development)
        - Frame for YR, it would be great to have headless simulators available.
            - With fully-fledged VMs, more than containers to access raw resources.
            - Problems like each simulator is an ecosystem with learning curve.
        - Frame for robotics in general
            - Several dimensions like photo-realism and physics realism.
            - So easy to get photo-realistic simulators with GPU that doing anything else.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FcQ6tOwQgDh.png?alt=media&token=3bc402dc-fe75-4b03-bce5-d0a8e4cea053)
        - Nvidia Isaac
            - "The Gorilla" around SV, as Jetson is easy to get for performance on robots.
            - Photorealistic, accurate
            - Some other simulators claim better physics engines, but not photo realistic.
        - Unity
            - Game Engine ramping up on robotics simulations
            - Promising, but hard to install, mandatory license (free ones available).
            - Some companies offer services, e.g. https://roboticsimulationservices.com/
        - Gazebo
            - Related to ROS
            - Open source and more flexible
            - Not backed by a large company, and feels less dynamic/driven in the changing landscape.
        - "Academic" simulators:
            - MuJoCo: Acquired by DeepMind.
            - SimBenchmark
            - CoppeliaSim: Can plug physics engine, can run headlessly.
            - WorldViz Vizard
        - Links shared during the presentation: https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/779070653122084864/1049411994169651200
        - Next week: Continue on simulation, review of the Unity ecosystem for robotics (Eric)
    - Dec. 21st
        - Review of Unity for robotics
        - Unity
            - Game tooling for 2D and 3D game, with physics engine.
            - It was popular when Eric used it (~2014) and apparently a leading company in the gaming industry.
        - Unity for robotics
            - Unity leveraging its virtual potential to robotics simulation.
            - https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub
            - Quite some focus on ROS robotic software
            - Extra tools (packages/plugins) to use in Unity for creating virtual robots, and for interacting with a ROS control software.
            - Asset library where free and paid contents allow to create worlds, etc
            - Several samples involve machine learning stages
                - Perceived as an enabling features for many new robotic applications.
                - Simulators can be very valuable to generate synthetic (=fake) realistic training data, thus cutting development cost significantly.
                - Similar placement from Nvidia Omniverse (maybe, as murky goals).
                - Note this kind of "sim2real" tooling is about closing the gap with running on a real robot in a real environment. It is independent from ML, so 2 interleaved trends here:
                    - sim2real for "plain" robots and for "ML" robots
                    - cross-feeding sim-ML, where sim allows training ML faster, and ML asking for more sim to get more data.
        - Content review
            - Quick overview of what Unity and the robotics pieces look.
            - Expected review of two tutorials on pose estimation and SLAM scenario
            - At this point, failed review of a pose estimation tutorial
                - https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Object-Pose-Estimation
                - Problems with package management, mainly (conflicts in their management by Unity apparently)
            - Just mentioned and shown screenshots of the SLAM tutorial
                - https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Nav2-SLAM-Example
                - Just lacked time to set this one up.
        - Questions
            - Physics engine? [Integrated to Unity](https://unity.com/solutions/programming-physics)
            - Problems from running on a Mac? Game development really happens on Windows, and Unity is from there.
                - Several problems in the ROS tutorials, but mostly independent from the OS.
                - Problems really in the package management by Unity, apparently (it imports dependency without reconciliation, leading to packages loaded twice, and incompatible versions)
                - When used in 2014, again on a Mac, it was working just fine already.
            - On running headless:
                - Yes, but perhaps not as others like Gazebo.
                - When we want to run an (interactive) scenario in Unity, the software builds a binary, which is in turn run. The binary is interactive, meaning it can accept input (from a game controller or ROS commands) and exposes output (telemetry, display streams, and to ROS topic adapters)
                - So we can run headless on the binary.
                - This is not "as headless as" Gazebo for example, as the build in Unity must happen in a licensed environment. Personal use builds in the UI (blocking it completely while it happens), and more professional solutions call for paid accounts.
                - With the binary, a colleague managed to wrap in a Docker container (on a custom image I built for our tentative CI for robotics service), and it runs just fine. So licensing is not a technical issue, it may just mean we cannot build a paid service using Unity.
            - Comparison with Gazebo
                - Main point to Eric is their different lineages
                - Gazebo is born in robotics.
                    - The robot is at the center.
                    - Tools organisation and purpose is for robots engineers, with facilities somewhat at hand reach for a roboticist mind set.
                    - World building is harder and demanding. E.g. Louis and Fabian last year on their lunar surface generation for the NASA challenge.
                - Unity is born in game development, world building.
                    - The world and its agents are at the center.
                    - A target robot is just one of many agents.
                    - Organisation is tailored for world building, rather than a center-of-the-universe robot. Tooling is more generic (in a way) and aimed at great illusions, rather than real-ish robot joints (which are modelled then in the ROS extensions for Unity).
                - Today roboticists are more likely to use Gazebo (when they do use a simulator!). But tomorrow, world building is to me the most important, as robust robots have to deal with some degree of "openendedness", which is impractical before launch, e.g. self-driving cars slow progress.
                    - I intend to publish soonish a review of companies (117 robotics international companies, to date).
                    - Relevant here:
                        - 29 do not use sim
                        - Gazebo is the first sim with 25
                        - Unity is third/fourth with 8
                        - Second is actually robot manufacturer's own simulator, and some same "in house" simulator, which sometimes means the manufacturer's (that's why Unity is either 3rd or 4th here---need to work more on this one)
                    - Depending on the work and attitude behind Gazebo, this snapshot may change well in the next few years.
                        - The Gazebo community and documentation are issues for many, apparently. It may change with the ROS2 industrial push.
                        - Unity is lauded for its documentation and community. This is however true for the game development side. On the ROS integration, quite limited.
