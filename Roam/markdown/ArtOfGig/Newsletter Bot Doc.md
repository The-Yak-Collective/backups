- About YakC boilerplate text (perhaps grabbed from a specific Roam page, so easy to update)
    - xxxx bot info xxx
- Automated newsletter parts
    - Upcoming events
        - xxxx Eventbot info xxx
        - Scope: recurring events and nonrecurring events, soonest first
        - User actions: 
            - Read details
            - Share this event (email, linkedin, twitter, ??)
            - Jump into event's discord channel and/or voice channel
        - [[Maier Fenster]] needs more discipline on event description - title should be longer and more descriptive
    - The last week's links
        - xxxx bot info xxx
            - scrape off tracking IDs
        - [[Maier Fenster]] if we have better definition of what is an interesting link, can further automatically refine what bot collects
    - Monthly leaderboard list of top/trending few channels
        - xxxx Signal bot info xxx
        - [[Maier Fenster]] done, i think
    - Channels showing signs of life (low-levels up from quiet)
        - xxxx Signal bot info xxx
        - [[Maier Fenster]] would need a short script to extract data from signal bot output
    - Excerpts from links in Yak Writings
        - xxxx bot info xxx
            - scrape off tracking IDs
        - [[Maier Fenster]] seems easy to write bot that does this. this is a subset of "last weeks link" data 
    - Excerpts from Soapbox, will need a bit of human markup and queuing
        - xxxx bot info xxx
        - [[Maier Fenster]] no idea how to do this. seems to me more efficient if done manually, at least until that time people use the channel a lot. how is it different form summarizing/extracting any text channel?
    - Agenda lists for all channels that have them
        - xxxx bot info xxx
        - [[Maier Fenster]] need to add that functionality, but not a biggie, as the data is all in database, so only need query
    - [[Maier Fenster]] what about gigs? and internal help-wanted?
