- A client project is one paid for by an external client, and participants get paid a share. To propose a client project, first get informal agreement from your potential client, and then put in a pitch on the [[Project Pitches]] page.
- THIS IS VERY ROUGH
- The only client project so far is [[Neurofuturama]]
- Our broad operating principle is that YC is a "weird surge capacity" organization that can offer capabilities individual members may want to offer their clients. The focus is on INDIVIDUAL project leads. YC is like a crowd-sourced wingman/backend, not the front-end organization.
- The goal of client projects is NOT to provide primary income to members. Members are expected to focus primarily on developing their own individual consulting practices, not turn into de facto dependents on YC-sourced gigs. The primary goal is to provide some supplementary income, opportunities for learning and collaboration, exposure to new clients and sectors, and so on.
- Not all client projects undertaken by members are official "YC client projects". We expect that most collaboration on gigs will in fact not be "official" but simply happen as part of natural networking and resources like the [[Take a Gig, Leave a Gig]] page. 
- A YC client project is such that will be branded with YC branding, featured on our website, have the official backing of the group, and count towards any credit accounting.
- A YC client project is either brought in by a member (a **sourced project**) or a potential new client who approaches us through our marketing presence, and is previously unknown to us (a **cold approach project**).
- A **sourced project** will generally be set up as a set of subcontracts to the participating members by the member sourcing it. They may, at their discretion, carve up the project into a personal component and a component for the Yak Collective, or make the project a fully Yak Collective project, in which case they earn a finder's fee.
- Sourced projects are brought to the partners for review, and are either greenlit or not based on whether the member and partners can agree on the terms. If the project is brought in by an experienced YC member, they will generally be expected to run it, perhaps with a partner on board as co-lead. If they are brought in by inexperienced members, they may be asked to find a suitable co-lead.
- Cold approach projects are handled by one of the partners as lead if accepted.
- Greenlit client projects are required to contribute a percentage of the total project value to the [[YC Fiat Fund]] and may make use of the marketing infrastructure and resources.
- Projects that are not greenlit are not necessarily bad projects, but might simply be unsuitable to pursue as official YC projects. Members are still welcome to network among themselves, form teams, and collaborate on them, and use the open elements of our infrastructure such as the Discord or Roam database.
- There is no standard fee structure at the moment. We are dealing with projects on a case-by-case basis to establish healthy precedents through trial and error.
- For official YC client projects, members who have already contributed to internal projects (either content, or infrastructure) should be given priority in staffing client projects, modulo expertise matches. But the project principal and coordinator have final say in assignments to make the project actually work. 
- It is the board of partners' responsibility to monitor for violations of governance principles and decide what to do.
