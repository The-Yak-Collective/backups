- Licenses are the tip of the iceberg
- MIT/GPL etc is bikeshedding
- Once you know what you want to do, picking the license is not hard
- Balance between let's use IP/let's not screw up on IP is opposite of corporations
- YC members often have secondary obligations to employers etc
    - When YC does a consulting gig, this issue is on LSD not steroids
- YC has no set goal... doesn't work
- We're doing open innovation
- We're trying to seed an ecosystem
- No IP law on Mars
    - If Elon Musk has his way there never will be
- Reminders
    - It is IP even if we ignore it
    - IP is a negative right
    - If we are not sensitive, we will miss both IP and opportunities to use it
    - IP = non-tangible things of value, registered or not
        - Usually a negative right
    - If it has value, IP guy can find a way to protect it
- Approaches
    - Systemic
        - Plan for "traffic jams"
        - Venkat: OnShape example for free version
        - Github etc
    - Pragmatic
        - IP is about value capture
        - IP is about controlling chokepoint
        - IP is about enticing
            - The product we want to sell is the YC
            - And/or specific members or services
            - And/or a world view
- One question: How can IP help us reach our goals, or at least not interfere
    - This presumes we can articulate our goals..., probably no strategy though
    - Example: Goal of building "packages" of technical knowledge, to sell. Use IP to make package more valuable. Make sure IP is available for that.
    - How do we get IP
    - How do we keep IP
    - How do we avoid IP
    - What do we do with it?
- One decision we should make, slowly
    - What is the YC IP attitude
    - We have a diversity of feelings and desires
        - Can we satisfy all? Anarchists, capitalists, do-gooders
        - Want Yak Collective to be a safe place, no IP mistakes
        - Easy... if you don't want to think about IP, you don't have to
- Specific IP issues of rover
    - Course (education) generation
    - S/w design of BOS
    - Specific s/w components
    - Insights into robot design and usage
    - Propreity information leak-in
    - Gig or $dayjob where only some of the YR members take part, which build on IP from YR project, as well as work
    - Personal brand recognition enhanced by YR
    - Data generated by our experiments
    - If we get to Mars...

- Some models/parts to consider
    - IP is free
    - Basic IP is free
    - YC/YR has shop rights, yaks have ownership
    - Anything using YR IP must also be free
    - Variosu profit/non-profit licenses
    - Sponsors
        - Renting out YR brand
    - Random access... if anybody cares about particular IP and gets permission from others, they can protect it (at whose expense?) and share with all
- Dividing up
    - Various pie-dividing schemes
    - Note that since IP is often negative, dividing up IP causes degradation
        - Best if yaks pre-assign IP (to extent possible)
- Examples of IP
    1. patent
    2. design
    3. copyright
    4. trade secret
        - not directly relevant re: working in public
        - BUT... risk of accidentally leaking $dayjob stuff
    5. Trademark
    6. Personal brand (reputation)
        - BIRGing is a particular risk
    7. Data -- is not "IP"
        - Machine learning cases... models that clearly use data from some traceable source, eg. code, recognizable imagery
    8. Insight
    9. Know-how (what you know but have difficulty explaining)
        - Fingerspitzengefuhl belongs in this category
