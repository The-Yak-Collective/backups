- April 11th [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]] roadmap meeting collaborative discovery and mapping exercise.
- FIRST 15 MINUTES: Google around the topic of "AI + Blockchain" any way you like, and try to **find interesting links, and share them here with brief one-sentence comments**. Next 45 minutes, we do a show-and-tell of the most interesting thing each person found.

    - [How AI Can Protect the Blockchain](https://hackernoon.com/how-ai-can-protect-the-blockchain) — Mostly a light-on-details sales pitch. The idea seems to be to use ML/AI to tune smart contract parameters in real time to help smooth out the operation of PoS chains and (maybe?) make some attacks more difficult. #[[Nathan Acks]]

        - > Untangling the way AI thinks
Regardless of how great AI is, people won’t use it if they don’t trust it. One of the issues that has put the brakes on broader adoption of AI is the impossibility to explain decisions made by the computer. With the possibility to record the decision-making process, AI can gain public trust much sooner.

By using the blockchain for artificial intelligence, we can make the way computers think more transparent. A distributed ledger can store every decision made by AI, data point by data point, and make them available for analysis. With a blockchain, you can also be sure that the information is tamper-resistant from recording to examination.

        - > Other start-ups are using blockchains to open access to the artificial intelligence models themselves. Dr. Goertzel has created SingularityNET, a blockchain that will serve as a link among A.I. services around the world. If one artificial intelligence module is unable to come up with an answer, it can consult with others, and provide compensation if one of the other modules is able to get it right.

“It lets you have a network of A.I.s that nobody owns,” Dr. Goertzel said.

- ## **Open Discussion**
- Q1: What sense making insights have you come with as we've been talking?
- Q2: How might this be relevant to anything we might do at Yak Collective?
- Big Picture Themes: AI is communist and Blockchains are libertarian (Peter Thiel)
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - The bot making that Maier is doing is connected to Q2
- [[Nathan Acks]]
    - Idea from Commits: Using AI as a generative prompt for ideas. 
        - Could have something that would mine the proposal log or something before that, and then generating own ideas as a Yak Subconscious for making proposals
        - AI being used to both dismantle and bolster the blockchain
        - Microsoft is moving away from source code as being a source of confidentiality
        - Came up in recent break of Microsoft repos
            - Now assume that source code is always leaked and that any security measures in the system has to be opened up for scrutiny.

        - As a DAO, what is my biggest worry? 
            - Getting taken over and the money being directed towards some unintended purpose or mission
            - Can we have an AI complement to measure health and status of a DAO
    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - Roles based approach towards organization
        - Blockchain is amenable to role based access
        - Conduct parallel surveillance of the community to grant access

    - [[Nathan Acks]]
        - This is already in place commonly outside of blockchains
    - [[Commits Vortex]]
        - Why surveillance rather than using AI to nudge or incentivize activity?
    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - Why not both?
