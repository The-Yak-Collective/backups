- Hey folks!
    - My name is Tyler White, 25
    - I live in Auckland, New Zealand
    - I have been working as a data analyst for an EdTech startup for two years (first job out of uni), supporting data needs across the company
    - I studied Engineering Science, Philosophy, and Psychology. I plan to return to uni to study a Masters of Operations Research and Analytics in 2024
    - I have been reading YakCollective writers for a number of years now. The fermi estimation stuff convinced me to pull the trigger on joining this Discord server.
    - I have been indie-curious since early 2023. I plan to stay in the paycheck world to continue learning skills on the job and go indie in 4-5 years time.
