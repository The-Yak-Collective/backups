        - **Rover** OS
            - Diversity, low volume for a given "kind" (e.g. rover)
            - Need the right metaphores
            - What is a rover? How to qualify?
                - Last time we talked about it: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/kZRPqFN4E
        - Is ROS an OS?
            - OS often about scheduling and other resource management. ROS has none.
            - Parallel with Linux distributions
            - Does it provide the "right" abstraction level?
            - No default user interface (e.g. shell for Linux, Finder for MacOS)
            - It did not live up to the label of "OS", based on our reviews
                - Marginal extras compared to directly using, say, Linux or maker libraries (e.g. Beaglebone's)
                - Gets in the way
        - Hello World of an OS
            - `ls` kind of command, to start feeling the concept (here centered on the file system), see the list of sensors/actuators, etc
            - Typical sample program on Arduino, etc is the LED blinking---safe and simple.
            - As an operator, expecting the same basic experience (e.g. shell + `ls` / operating systems navigation commands)
            - Deploy on N bots should not give very different basic experience
            - Possible `ls` to detail the orientation from the viewpoint of the rover
        - Need for an "interface" (also "user interface")
        - Perspective from Asimov's 3 laws
            - Protect humans
            - Protect others from harm
            - Protect yourself
        - Nvidia Isaac https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/
            - Never say OS, but platform
            - Jetson penetration (see Jascha Feb 1st), Isaac on software
        - Perhaps a strong approach is "identity system" (self, body boundaries, safety)
        - Contemporary problems:
            - Multi-robot / multi-agent systems (air traffic control, fleet monitoring)
                - Where is the boundary? 1 robot, 1 fleet?
                - ROS makes communication easy, but nothing on what to do (e.g. protocols)
                    - Now to get fleet controller, basically need a "server"
                    - Problem of decentralization
                - Old problems, but now getting out there
                - Perhaps time to (re)approach?
                    - Extensive academic research since the 90s
                    - Problems of cost: Now cheaper to make actual multi-robots
            - Decentralization, place of blockchain technologies?
