        - **Rover** OS
            - Diversity, low volume for a given "kind" (e.g. rover)
            - Need the right metaphores
            - What is a rover? How to qualify?
                - Last time we talked about it: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/kZRPqFN4E
        - Is ROS an OS?
            - OS often about scheduling and other resource management. ROS has none.
            - Parallel with Linux distributions
            - Does it provide the "right" abstraction level?
            - No default user interface (e.g. shell for Linux, Finder for MacOS)
            - It did not live up to the label of "OS", based on our reviews
                - Marginal extras compared to directly using, say, Linux or maker libraries (e.g. Beaglebone's)
                - Gets in the way
        - Hello World of an OS
            - `ls` kind of command, to start feeling the concept (here centered on the file system), see the list of sensors/actuators, etc
            - Typical sample program on Arduino, etc is the LED blinking---safe and simple.
            - As an operator, expecting the same basic experience (e.g. shell + `ls` / operating systems navigation commands)
            - Deploy on N bots should not give very different basic experience
            - Possible `ls` to detail the orientation from the viewpoint of the rover
        - Need for an "interface" (also "user interface")
        - Perspective from Asimov's 3 laws
            - Protect humans
            - Protect others from harm
            - Protect yourself
        - Nvidia Isaac https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/
            - Never say OS, but platform
            - Jetson penetration (see Jascha Feb 1st), Isaac on software
        - Perhaps a strong approach is "identity system" (self, body boundaries, safety)
        - Contemporary problems:
            - Multi-robot / multi-agent systems (air traffic control, fleet monitoring)
                - Where is the boundary? 1 robot, 1 fleet?
                - ROS makes communication easy, but nothing on what to do (e.g. protocols)
                    - Now to get fleet controller, basically need a "server"
                    - Problem of decentralization
                - Old problems, but now getting out there
                - Perhaps time to (re)approach?
                    - Extensive academic research since the 90s
                    - Problems of cost: Now cheaper to make actual multi-robots
            - Decentralization, place of blockchain technologies?
    - January 18th, 2022 UTC: Maier on extended OS discussion ~~Licensing~~
        - Continuing discussion on OS after [last week](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/1Pa3V1k_u).
        - Licensing will be discussed later in the cycle.
        - No update on WWG at this point.
        - Attendees:
            - Anuraj
            - Brian

        - Update on "Mars Garden"
            - By Mission Control Space Services Inc
                - A "garden" made and available
                - Indoor lunar analogue testbed, usable on demand.
                - Provides map with different conditions (impressive different lightning depending on region)
            - Canadian Space Agency "Mars yard"
            - European Rover Challenge
                - Relatively large area with craters and boulders; reddish soil
                - Yearly event for participants to try rovers
        - BOS ideas and discussion points
            - Discussion on scope
                - BOS would see Linux same as a BIOS
                - 
            - Issue of defining safety (software and physical)
            - Rover "activities" different from "missions"
                - "OS scheduling" becomes a different mechanism
                - Activities map to set of OS processes, but for applications.
                - BOS processes (provided by the system to applications) are not activities in this terminology
            - System services
                - Location, state, etc?
                - Autonomy as a service???
                    - Question on "autonomy"
                    - Discussion on practical subsets, like energy management.
                - Criteria: Do they affect the state of the rover, or can be isolated?
            - Parallel with Linux kernel
                - Kernel provides two categories of operations, user space and system
                - Activity are affordances provided by actuators
                - Actuator as potential central part. Or closed-loops?
            - Metaphors
                - Butler?
                - Field agent/spy?
                - "Economy of activities", like how economies lead some activities to work (e.g. what I do outside the US cannot impact directly the US economy)
        - Draft on possible boot-up procedure
            - Text document with list of things to do on booting up
            - Including security (with blockchain), integrity, safety, services
            - Autonomic aspects
            - Note for later -- crash-only systems that only startup once and never shut down except by crashing
