- The 2021 builds are all experimental discovery builds, and each has a letter/number designation. The numbers are all 1, since these are the parallel version 1 builds, and the letters are X, Y, Z, W, and U following the USAF experimental flyoff prototyping naming conventions.
- [[Wonderful Wandering Growth]] by [[Maier Fenster]]
    - rover will walk around in garden and look like it is interacting with terrain, rather than just brute forcing its way forward
- [[YR Infinity and Beyond]] by [[Anuraj R]]
- [[YR Abio Flex Wanderer]] by [[Eric Platon]]
    - Target for Dec 13th demo day: Show how a bot can build internal models of its environment automatically (e.g. what is a leg in "data space", what is a rock). This is the base of this build plans about autonomy.
- [[YR: Nature is Murder]] by [[Venkatesh Rao]]
- [[YR Go and See]] by [[Victor Hill]]
- [[Stubborn Pursuit of a Path]] by [[Rhett Garber]]
    - Rover will be operated on the floor of my office, able to take a photo and report telemetry. Roughly my demo from last update, but hopefully more reliable. With some guidance I'm sure I could accept commands or report telemetry via other interfaces (over a VPN?)
- [[YR Gradient Ascent]] by [[Sai Prasanna]]
    - Rover will have teleoperation via streamlit, an Obstacle avoidance with vision, and a object detection and follower module rudimentary (coconet) with option to change the object to be followed.
    - Stretch goal: Integrate CLIP and perform some zero shot object detection and/or navigation with NLP.
