- Discussion
    - [[Anuraj R]] 
        - TLDR - trust in system collapsed -> price collapse
        -  Can a cryptocurrency be created without backing of nation state
    - [[Commits Vortex]]
        - Avalance blockchain
    - [[Maier Fenster]]
        - smart contracts weakness and other problems, gaming smart contracts? 
        - do we need a central bank with tools to deal with currency attacks
        - they didn't have mechanism to have control and fight attacks
            - actually, looks like they thought they did, but did not survive the danger zone - see the matt levine link above
    - [[Nathan Acks]]
    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - what could be done to get guarentees for stable coins
            - back it up with assets
        - if not then have other means to build confidence in eg sovereign bond for countries
        - eg Ecuador pegged to USD, Euro 
        - to what extent can one currency be pegged to another? it would be nice to see this quantified
    - [[Ben Mahala]]
        - from Discord - RAI stable coin https://reflexer.finance/
        - https://blog.bitmex.com/luna-brothers-inc/?utm_source=Sendgrid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Email 
            - Talks about derivatives in the stablecoin context. You can create a 'pseudo stablecoin' yourself by hand using something like BitMEX swaps
    - [[Grigori Milov]]
    - Open Floor
        - [[Nathan Acks]]
            - if you want to do a stable coin then use a basket of currencies and exchange between them, stable fraction of value to the blockchain ecosystem coins
            - if all these around for 100 years then it increases confidence in the ecosystem
        - [[Maier Fenster]]
            -  Can a cryptocurrency be created without backing of nation state
                - People want to be confident that they will get their money
                - Two kinds of trust. 
                    - This will be around tomorrow in a similar form
                    - You can trust me
                - When somone attacks nation state currency then central bank can do a lot of things
            - there are exists in a death spiral even if there is 300 years of intertial trust
        - [[Anuraj R]] - Can what central banks do be automated? 
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - Mechanism trust
                - Intertial trust, as [[Nathan Acks]] called in shared history
                    - US economic system is ~300 years, youngest form of USD ~50 years old
                - the monopoly of violence argument fails at some levels
                - cleverest mechanism trust cannot make up for inertial trust
        - [[Nathan Acks]]
            - how commited to the external players see the internal players to keep the system going
            - if things go bad then interial trust plays a big role
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - push-pull mechansim 
                    - one is the shared history
                    - second is the extent to which one is willing to defend the idea
            - a lot skepticism by many people
        - [[Maier Fenster]]
            - if everyone is anonymous then people have much lower involvement
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]] this is true for nation state currencies too with cash, what percentage of the economy is anonymous
