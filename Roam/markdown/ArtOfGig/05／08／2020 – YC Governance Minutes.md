- **05/08/2020 – YC Governance Meeting Minutes**
- **Meeting Lead:** [[Venkatesh Rao]]
- **Chat Format:** [[Amazonian Group Read]] (AGR)
- **Description:** Per AGR format, take 10 minutes to read section 2.1 and 2.2 of the [IETF's "The Tao of IETF" governance doc](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/#what). Round-robin discussion follows.
- Round Robin Chat
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]:
- Experience in governing online communities began in 2003, working as a community manager, and managing early Facebook communities
- "Managing online communities is 2x-3x times harder than running a business online."
- It seems easier bc it's cheap, free software online, and "it's a bunch of people hanging out together online". It is not easier.
- It's "a little bit humbling" to try and run an online community.
- There has to be a core group to shepherd and think about it consciously.
- __Ed note: Audio dropped out at this point the call, had to reconnect. – Alex__
- **Prompt to Group: Reflect on one principle you've picked up from your administration of, or participation in, online communities.**
- [[Ardhura Husra]]:
    - "It's very loose in a way that... you have to go with the flow, but nobody knows what they're doing as well."
    - "There's a curve between being authoritative and being liberal, and you have to find that sweet spot."
- [[Alex Wagner]]:
    - Trying to get online communities going is almost like political organizing, with regards to reaching to people one-to-one, and them to join.
    - To seed an online community is akin to building "low-key political alliances".
- [[Chris Reid]]:
    - I really like, "directions, not words".
    - "I also really liked the idea of [Requests for Comment(RFC)](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/#rfcs)."
    - This is the notion that "the person who is asking for other people to do work, has already done work up-front".
- [[Greg Docter]]:
    - One principle that's top of mind: "the leaders of the group must participate early and often, while giving away power to other community members when it's appropriate."
    - Highly suggests the book, ["Get Together: How to Build a Community with Your People"](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Together-build-community-people/dp/1732265194), for basic principles in building online communities.
- [[Greg Kramer]]
    - Participated in [Enterprise Scrum group](http://www.enterprisescrum.com/), led by [Mike Beedle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Beedle). Beedle has been working on similar problems as far as figuring out how best to do online community governance.
- [[Grigori Milov]]
    - Ran a community for a large consultancy. Grew from 10 to 10,000 people.
    - "One principle: everything you do with communities, is an experiment."
    - If you want to grow a community, you must embrace the idea of running a lot of experiments.
    - Or even better, you must __get good at running experiments.__
    - [[Johannes "xmj" Meixner]]
    - Deigned to skip bc of bad audio.
- [[John Grant]]
    - Engaging online communities as a means of research, and exploring the concept of lifelong learning.
    - Mostly in blockchain and wardley-mapping communities.
    - Lurkers, "the silent majority". How can we incentivize them to participate?
    - "The value flow goes both ways."
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - "I'm a lurker-par-excellence".
    - "I like working with the right people. I generally don't like working with people at all". Prefers to work from behind-the-scenes and support people who have more of a face, typically.
    - "In online communities, I like to find ways to guide and enable people. I'm not going to be the life of every conversation."
- [[Mocks]]
    - Opting to lurk, passes mic.
- [[Sachin Benny]]
    - Also, self-professed lurker.
    - Noticed that group of core contributors in an online community changes over time.
    - With regards to Tao of IETF, managing communities can be tricky because you are managing emerging behaviors, good and bad. Good governance does this.
    - While IETF "rejects kings", they still have positions of authority and a hierarchy.
- [[Scott Garlinger]]
    - Currently working with a community of musicians, and getting them work in the internet age.
    - It's important to make the value prop for lurkers very clear – why they should hang around, and why they should participate.
- [[Vinay Débrou]]
    - One thing that stuck from experience managing communities: you have to consistently ask good questions to provide direction to the community.
    - "If you are just preaching", it tends to have a negative, anti-growth effect.
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - We will keep Friday governance chats to a 30-minute limit.
    - Setting a weekly habit, so we don't have to think about all of the ideas and concepts at once.
    - "The idea is to create a track of collective learning that anyone can jump into and participate in, starting at any time."
    - [[Governance Studies]]
    - Post suggested readings or references here. Venkat will periodically review.
    - Learning each other's preferences and styles
    - "Every community is kinda different, depending on who self-selects into it. "
    - A community of musicians is different than a community of writers is different than a group of indie consultants.
    - "We will slowly discover while talking to each other, what the preferred styles of governance are."
    - For each session, we will devote it to a specific problem, such as the previously mentioned, "Lurker Problem".
    - Closing Thoughts
- [[Vinay Débrou]]
    - "I really liked the concepts of 'end user empowerment', 'the IETF is not neutral', and 'we are willing to develop new technologies to solve our own problems' ."
- [[John Grant]]
    - I like the approach of "short meetings, that are quite dense", with "asynchronous work to think about during the week".
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "In closing, please post any links you want to share in [[Governance Studies]] and we'll meet next Friday at the same time."
