- Page for the #terraforming-workshop channel proposal on Discord
- Format
    - We read a paper/article or do a small learning task every week. New readings and prompts are posted on Thursdays.
    - The readings are oriented around a couple seasons. First season is an orientation to the first terraforming. The second season goes sector by sector using John Doerr's book speed and scale plan as a framework. The third season focuses on collective action in the speed and scale plan. 
- Curriculum

                - the major element of the plan is the aggressive reduction of fossil fuels; the proposed scenario calls for **reduced petroleum use by 91% in 2045 from 2022 levels** at which point the state is expected to achieve carbon neutrality
                - the proposed scenario calls for ambitious deployment of non-combustion technologies (clean energy, ZEVs, appliances, etc.) and strong consumer adoption of clean tech and fuel options
                - Carbon removal, either through direct air capture or attached to emitting facilities, is a component of every scenario evaluated as part of the scoping plan process, as is some reliance on carbon sequestration
                - the proposed scenario for natural and working lands calls for **2–2.5 million acres to be treated statewide annually** in forests, shrublands/chaparral, and grasslands through prescribed fire, harvesting and thinning
