        - > I occasionally still muse on what a yakfit project could be too. Primal movement stuff like your Strength Side guys‚Ä¶ who basically scare me as having unattainable looks for normies and who also don‚Äôt actually move that well (acknowledging self as movement snob)
        - > https://youtu.be/DZPvK1MWGdg
        - > and MovNat, Ido Portal, Katie Bowman (‚Äúmovement snacks‚Äù ftw), MovementbyDavid, Hybrid Calisthenics, and Original Strength (tx @Matthew Sweet (UTC) for that rec)
        - > ‚Ä¶ but maybe the deeper traditions of like Shi Heng Yi who has the Strength Side guys‚Äô look but for realz, really curious what allowed him to share what he does since my martial arts instructors talked a lot about how all the real stuff was village-secret level for most of all time + in the Chinese traditions all the people who really knew something died or were killed in the cultural revolution

        - > The big divide for me is around fitness-for-what: high level sports and endurance stuff v playing the long game. Used to do the former, kinda forced into the latter now so have to be pretty strategic. Also no more ‚Äúworkout‚Äù thinking, move more all through the day is where it‚Äôs at for buttjobs. Known paradox: If your work is on your feet, there‚Äôs nothing like the moment when you get to take a seat. If your work is stationary, nothing like the moment when you get to stride out. 
    - `infinitness` `infitness` ?
- ## Experiment | Ideas with reasonable science behind them
    - Choose Your Own Adventure. DIY structure. Many of us prolly already doing some or many experiments! Share on the thread on #yakfit-üí™ channel. Earlier example is [Josh Waitzkin](https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/) and [tai chi](https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/the-art-of-learning). 
    - Big reframe: aging is not a slow slide into decline. In tai chi, you aren't considered to really hit your stride until around 70, shifting to that mindset pretty big change for many of us. Suggest Fire Method v. Water Method a good construct for playing the long game.
    - Goal of this YakCon siderail to explore a YakFit-üí™ strategy for playing a long game for fitness, functional fitness as something that makes everything else better. BASF ads as model ‚Äî "we don't make the thing, we make it better." 
        - {{video: https://youtu.be/ZJHPpsb3FzM}}
    - Rightsizing time and energy commitment for the long game in contradistinction to big-push styles like American football, Crossfit, and other approaches modeled on wartime training like Jocko and Navy Seal types. When I studied tai chi, the really good elders practiced 4, 6 hours a day. Similar shift with meditation practices for monks versus householders.
        - Fire Method example, willingness to get hurt. See Kotler below also.
            - {{video: https://vimeo.com/717945664}}
        - New example is [Commoncog](https://commoncog.com/2022-commoncog-recap/) guy. 
‚ÄúAbout a month ago I relocated to the capital of Malaysia to train for the Malaysian Senior Judo Nationals. I train Judo four hours a day, and have basically cut out everything else from my life for a period of three months.‚Äù

            - ‚ÄúSteve was able to sustain his determined focus, clear vision, and exceptional creativity precisely because he was so disciplined about tending to his self-care. He took the time to feed his fire. **He had a meditation practice, exercised regularly, nourished his body and mind, had a loving family, and maintained a deep sense of purpose while building Apple.** [emphasis added]

‚ÄúSteve‚Äôs downfall as a leader was that, as attentive as he was to his own wellbeing, he was inattentive to the wellbeing of his people. He challenged and stretched people outside of their comfort zone, making them better and helping them fulfill their highest potential, but often at the expense of their health.‚Äù

            - [Move All Day](https://www.nutritiousmovement.com/move-more-without-exercise/)
            - > Most days, I move first thing in the morning. I walk with a friend, so that my ‚Äúmovement time‚Äù is also my ‚Äúcoffee with a friend‚Äù date. Stacking my life this way, getting movement and something else I need/love to do, is key to fitting it all in. I always wear minimal shoes. A wide, flexible, and totally flat shoe means when I move, more of me is moving! At home, our family uses low tables and the floor instead of sitting in couches and chairs. When I am working, I have a dynamic workstation (I don‚Äôt work in the same position all the time), and I take movement breaks at my desk. While I am home, I use objects in and around my home to facilitate movement and I break up my workday with chores. Also, I take calls and do errands on foot, often at the same time. The bulk of our family time (before and after school, weekends, holidays) is spent outside, moving. We typically walk wherever we go‚Äîif we‚Äôre not going to walk the whole way there, then we park at a distance and walk the rest of the way.

    - cf ‚ÄúA conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett, author of Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain‚Äù
        - Q: Why do I have a brain?
        - A: Brain‚Äôs didn‚Äôt evolve so you can think, feel or see.¬†**They evolved to control bodies**. Everything your brain does ‚Äì think, feel, see, hear, etc. -- it does in the service of controlling your body. This is your brain‚Äôs most important job. Understanding this illuminates mysteries like: How are your mind and body linked? How does chronic stress seep under the skin and make you sick? Why are physical illnesses like heart disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease so similar to mental illnesses like depression? And why there is a growing epidemic of depression and anxiety around the world?
