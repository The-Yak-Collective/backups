- I’m an [[organizational development]] consultant turned [[product manager]].
- Currently paychecking, but want to eventually start my own indie practice!
- I’m a Product Manager at a studio called [Sanctuary Computer.](https://www.sanctuary.computer/)
- Before my PM role, I was doing large scale org change consulting work at [The Ready](https://theready.com/).
- I do some consulting work around org design, team effectiveness, and experimentation-based ways of working. Some individual coaching, too.
- I’m fascinated by [[Conway’s Law]]: the idea that an organization’s product mirrors its structure. I hope to build on this idea in my writing.
