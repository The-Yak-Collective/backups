- Victor -- suggestion combine with shared R&D
- Maier -- pull other way
    - [[Shared Rover R&D]]
    - Summer school is outreach
        - Type 1: yaks but not yet rover
            - more like grad school
        - Type 2: real output, community/performative... marketing, generating value, showcasing value for consulting etc.
- Objective (not mutually exclusive)
    - Venkat: Mutual peer-learning (eg: OnShape)
    - Anuraj: On-ramp course for rover building
        - Guest lectures on advanced rover building/programs
    - Jascha: bit wider... robotics program
        - already technical, but looking to get into robotics
        - "pothole filler" reskilling course
- Who's the target audience and wny
    - Maier
        - Limit, we can only give content suitable for ourselves
        - As an outline, EVERYTHING you need to know in order to get moving
        - More performative... how we see the knowledge scape
        - Examples 
- Synthesis
    - Already a plethora of material, can be curated
    - Needed: project-context learning
    - People who used it well (Jascha's course) = people who were kinda already onto what they wanted to do
    - "Newbots" industry -- low cost parts etc. 
        - Everybody is looking for "The box" 
        - Ag people are trying to team up and quickly do various specialized applications around a common, modular box, with a common software stack
        - Nvidia uses the Jetson ecosystem, Nvidia jail 
    - "Design principles" or "issues" having to do with newbots
        - What's the best way to provide this opinionated take
