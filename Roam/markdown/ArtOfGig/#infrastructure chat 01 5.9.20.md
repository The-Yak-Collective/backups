    - thanks for chatting @Sachin Benny (US Central) @Praful Mathur (US - NYC) @Venkatesh Rao (US Pacific) @dolearning (Kevin) @Grigori Milov (GMT+3) 
today's chat takeaways for me: 

we discussed how to provide more affordances for new members to sense make.
1. creating new member orientation materials with the ethos of giving helpful hints and general rules of engagement (empty stub here: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/vA90wJbvO 
will continue convo in #Infrastructure) 
2. providing a wkly voice chat space that could be an orientation hall and a way to build friendly connections
- **First topic:** [[Onboarding for New Yaks]]
    - Praful
        - How to understand how proposals work
        - Where are you supposed to be looking around ?
        - How are you supposed to involved ? 
        - In general, when you join it's very disorienting - esp if not active day-to-day ... 
            - calendar when things are happening has emerged
            - Sometimes it's hard... hey this chat is happening in 15 minutes
        - Not going to be super active
        - Having some hand-held thing 
            - tasks that we have everyone to do ... to get you familiar with github repo 
            - contribute your name to readme 
            - issue that you were confused about
            - is that going to be a major contributor 
        - SUGGESTION: have peers that are greeters? 
            - hackLA group - bonnie ? new member orientations Tuesday 6 PST. reaches out to orphan activities 
    - Venkat
        - Not even trying [to keep up]
        - Heuristic - overall network can be anarchic — build orientation around individual projects. It's ok to be confused and lost in general stream of convo. If there's a small work to work on collab projects, and self-select... That's the thing I'm hoping to solve for 
        - I don't think it's actually impt for everyone to be oriented in a general stream
        - Heuristic - overall 
    - Sachin
        - Don't consciously try to read everything or stay on top of things. 
        - Got lucky in joining first time. Convo going on was much less. These days just scan and have convos. 
        - Convos on DMs and look on Roam page for projects to collab. 
    - Kevin
        - Been following. Brand new. Temporary invite... Still orienting
        - Used to discord..
        - Figuring out where the chat was maybe a little harder. Not in infrastructure channel.. in the main channel.
        - Reading art of gig substack and tom's blog and venkat's block. Following both of them. Some grounding 
    - Not all volunteer opps are available to jump on
        - Not sure how to tackle trust/competence thing
        - let people fail 
        - earn access to critical infrastructure 
    - We're not trying to be intimidating ... but not hand holding either. Somewhere in b/n. 
    - Venkat
        - Expect ppl to sensemake
            - Good strong open source projects.. usually have commercial support. We're trying to do a POC that's extremely shoe-string
        - ship something of value... we don't have much of a surplus till then. be helpful as we have bandwidth for. 
    - What things should new members know first day, first week ? 
        - Venkat - Who they know is more important. already knowing people in the group abstractly... people you actually know as friends e.g. refactor camp
            - link to 1-2 people that are farther in the integration. or link strangers together that they might resonate with. if you can solve that problem, real value to connect interesting talents!
        - Praful - maybe first page they look at upcoming voice chat... and join the chats 
        - Orientation mentors?
            - Newbie chat - hey here are the resources involved - if you're interested in this kind of thing 
                - project leads may be come once in a while - this is what we're interested in...
        - affiliation ... look for one directory to ping 
    - Darren 
        - on board for newbie chat
        - but other consideration is more members do create more noise... how do we create spaces for collaboration / value ? 
    - Kevin
        - hints rather than a complete guide
        - interplay of smaller working groups within larger community
    - Sachin
        - newbie chat makes sense
    - Grigori
        - Less explaining, more doing (for newbies).. small project 5-10 people? with guidance for longer-standing participant
        - simple questions, difficult answer
    - Venkatesh
        - Expectation settin rather than explaining.. 
        - +1 on experimental, trial & error community... keep that in mind and navigate accordingly
    - Creation of knowledge. every week
    - Praful 
        - here's some helpful tips on how to play the game they may not be relevant (or outdated) 
- Venkat is the bottle neck for too many things
    - Doing things bc they want to w/o sending through central place
- Email newsletter
    - post an update on Roam that gets scraped? 
    - RSS automatic? 
    - clean exit opportunity ... people are bad at admitting failure. squatting... kill versions of things that aren't working. 
- Venkat never was able to get himself out of refactor camp org "activity darwinism"
