- Season 3 Reading Track (1/6/23 — TBD)
    - Kropotkin Was No Crackpot
        - Today's reading is __Kropotkin Was No Crackpot__ by Stephen Jay Gould: https://www.marxists.org/subject/science/essays/kropotkin.htm
Some prompts (provided by ChatGPT):
            - Kropotkin suggests that cooperation and mutual aid can be applied to human societies and governance structures.
                - What are the potential benefits and challenges of adopting such an approach?
                - Can you think of any real-world examples where cooperation has been prioritized over competition in governance?
                - Can elements of his theory be integrated into existing governance structures to address societal issues?
        - Bryan
            - General response
                - must accept that nature is amoral, but morality is a key component of human evolution/cooperation
                - The gladitorial mindset is what leads to evolutionary arms races (Darwin economy) - big deer antlers, doping in sports, plastic surgery, etc
                    - predators can go extinct
                - Ironic that it seems Kropotkin was so impactful with his work on anarchism because he was a very moral guy, something most subsequent anarchists seemed to struggle with
                - was reading some other candidates for today's session, was struck that most anarchists are anarchists because they hold the competition view, but don't reap benefits of anarchy, whereas average people who hold cooperative mindset are freer, even under tyranny.
            - Benefits
                - Feelings of safety
                - Resiliency/antifragility
            - Challenges
                - probably have to accept a satisficing mode over an optimizing mode
                - still have to fend off non-cooperative hostiles
                    - cooperatives have to have guardians
                - how to effectively organize cooperative groups in hostile environments with lots of actors
        - Matthew
            - Don't really agree with idea that nature has morality, but still there is some morals especially in human
            - open source AI tooling outpacing incumbents
                - google having no moat
                - communities more powerful than companies
            - challenge: dissolving conflict is very hard
                - like an individual trying to achieve enlightment
                    - nirvana that is rare to achieve
                    - if you can achieve, can you incentivize it?
                    - probably not, has to emerge
                    - incentives create a new game
            - examples
                - semicoordinated COVID response
                - markets usually have rules and constraints
            - incorporating
                - can't really force cooperation
                - has to be pressure from environment that is so overwhelming that it overcomes competition

    - Top Talent
        - https://nadia.xyz/top-talent
        - Jenna
            - unease w/ idea of best and brightest
            - how do we raise all boats?
            - Burn Notice, The Last Dip
                - the cleverest person solves complicated problems
                - navy has long tradition of teaching people to be clever
            - difference between A player and linchpin
                - so much openness to neurodiversity...those people are also very good at very specific things, they just need that thing
        - Kiran
            - concern about putting 10x developer on pedestal
            - saving grace for distributions
                - lots of movement that happens underneath
                - tendency in tech of thinking of people as being really good at what they do
                    - but high performance can be anomaly, sometimes you hit rough spots, stuck in realm of mediocrity
                - perhaps more representative of a snapshot in time
            - don't think companies are aware of these tendencies
                - recent tech layoffs...nobody understands the choices that are being made
                - high performance is very subjective
            - thinking about rules
                - relation between thick/thin rules and the type of talent distribution you choose
                - thick - people need to cut through complexity
                - thin - probably need bureacrats to step in and help
        - Venkat
            - does believe the model is fundamentally correct as a description of what you see
                - but it doesn't explain why
                - no use getting mad about it
                - might choose one based on preference
            - bimodal distribution
                - 10x is a bad label
                - two different subtypes
                    - neurodivergent person, other trait, which makes you exceptionally good at a thing
                        - this category isn't conflated with 10x dev category
                        - people like this often flounder
                    - someone who has undergone orginzational enlightenment
                        - found ownership, permissionlessness, agency
                        - find things that they can own
                        - when you remove blockers of effectiveness, your relationship to authority/constraints/etc, you feel a sense of ownership that allows person from exercising agency
            - Feyman biography
                - talent vs. genius
                    - you can grind it out, or you can just see things entirely different
            - two subtypes of bimodal org
        - Grigori
            - recruitment and firing is broken most places
            - if you think about pareto distribution, you hiring mgmt consultancy
            - most companies are unaware of distribution, bad at hiring, but good at pretending that talent program is good
            - you can't really choose a distribution of talent
                - not really a good definition of talent in the original study
                - often talking about executive talent anyways
            - simplest distribution of talent: whoever gets the job done
                - nature of work is changing
            - impossible to apply to small businesses (see exec talent point above)
                - talent is scale-dependent
    - Fri, Mar 31st, 2023: https://gk3fyi.substack.com/p/the-cost-of-craft 
        - Ananth
            - tension between craft and metrics: football / soccer 
                - some teams that are able to play games and win consistently 
        - Jenna
            - not interested in solving the problems of large organizations
            - self-organizing systems, yak collective type of groups are more interesting to her
            -  she was involved in exactly this tension — the good enough design threshold 
                - craiglist has shit design yet persists
            - hard to make for just one person or for the masses 
        - Kiran 
            - hits home for him given his experience
            - too many things have been pushed to the protocol layer and everything built on top of the protocol layer will have its own aesthetic 
            - hard to maintain aesthetic across devices on amazon
        - Sachin
            - we read a lot of these principles in coordination headwinds 
            - there is always a BDFx setting the course for a particular product 
            - a lack of some type of desired technology that you need a BDFx to do that 
        - Shreeda 
            - experiencing this a lot in my current $dayjob and liked the article 
            - though i agree about craftsman virtue ethics not being fully justified itself 
            - read shopcraft as soulcraft / zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance 
        - Venkat 
            - starting with craft they're very stubborn about it or something 
            - the ethical way of being a craft oriented person: you have to let go of people 
            - aesthetic bullies — craft oriented dictators gone wrong. rant and rave... yell at people for being corrupt 
            - he feels hostility and skepticism because he is usually on the other side 
            - the good thing about the article is that it recognizes that there's a balance needed, not profaning a sacred vision 
            - the alternative to craftsman ethos is protocol ethos — process for coordination versus defining end-state vision with precision. we're willing to shift the vision according to uncertainties. protocol-bureaucratic. feels lifeless and soulless to craft oriented persons. 
            - still falls in craftsman oriented as morally superior one
    - Fri, Mar 17th, 2023: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ecology#Core_concepts 
        - Ananth
            - likes the reading — reminds him of slime mold metaphor in coordination headwinds. "information takes the path of least resistance" 
            - he thought the ages thought to be lacking but liked robert k logan's iteration of it more
        - Bryan 
            - marshall mcluhan frustrates him — would be a twitter influencer posting big threads that sound cute but don't have a whole lot of substance
            - it's a good starting point and makes sense for when it was published (when new media was emerging)
            - last century has been an anomoly — historical anomaly. we figured out how to scale media that were thousands of years old and reach all corners of the earth 
            - but he doesn't think there will be a huge revolution of media — tiktok not very new, just leverages what exists in different ways
            - emberto echo, baudrillard, guettari (however you spell these names) — maybe go towards semiotics instead
        - Grigori 
            - interesting reads & he doesn't get frustrated bc it was written a long time ago and was revolutionary then
            - ages and transitions is most interesting part 
            - people are still using mental models from previous ages on social media and applying it to very different media 
            - we're already transitioning to a new age of media — what AI can produce is hard to distinguish from what humans produce... 
            - what does it mean to be an author? 
        - Jenna
            - always good to revisit mcluhan 
                - my rough notes
media all the way down
signaling all the way down
protocols all the way down
if this then that all the way down
systems thinking all way down
everything is connected all the way down

"a system" is bc someone decided on some borders (arbitrary or otherwise)

Liked the bit about what sense organ/s lead at different times
1. tribal age = ears
2. literacy age = eyes
3. print age = portable book which led to privacy in thought
4. electronic age = started with phone; return to environment w sound and touch, rather than sight

medium is the message
cf convo about the effect of publishing on Medium v Mirror or Paragraph, let alone LinkedIn
            - media all the way down, protocols all the way down = under the hood, systems thinking... which gets to the mystical... keep going down in layers
            - artificial edges around something and call it a system
            - back then, you only knew what the cool kids in your village are doing... 
        - Kiran
            - hadn't heard of McLuhan but had heard of his ideas already
            - his ideas have influenced stratechery 
            - the rise of each new medium corresponds to the downfall of another? 
            - broadcast media has propped up the nation state
            - new media could be the rise of the fifth estate? the common person 
            - each new version has had a lesser impact.... folklore, you've had to memorize things. books that you've had to memorize has far changed his mindset 
            - ownership / authorship with AI... using AI to generate new ideas hardly requires intervention on him. so it won't have a sticky effect or impact 
            - nice analogy with cities... walkable cities. close interactions with people
        - Madebo 
            - hasn't read the piece so going to react to what kiran said... 
            - transition from oral to generative age is an opportunity to r
        - Shreeda 
            - DJ F anecdote... obliteration of artists. competition... good luck with that.
            - originality and markets is something i really think about 
        - Venkat 
            - it was super influential for him ... somewhat sympathetic to bryan's take but you have to understand when he was writing... 
            - it used to take so much courage to say things like mcluhan back then... 
                - in today's world it doesn't take the same amount of courage right now to have these new types of thoughts
            - [lee de forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest) inventor of the triode who observed radio helped create a boost in pop culture / media 
                - these things were obvious but mcluhan had the courage to examine all the assumptions about media x society x culture x politics and flip some axes that were a little to sacred to people 
                - disrespecting the elites a bit.. 
            - people know mcluhan in media and resent him a bit bc his stuff is all in the water but they lack the same courage to make similar statements...

    - Fri, Feb 17th, 2023:  https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech
        - Ananth — listen mode
        - Aneesh
            - people have a voice but don't want to say anything 
            - if you want free speech, it has to be done on the government level 
            - he thinks we need platforms but just don't like the ones we have right now
            - if you unbundle a platform, it will get bundled again anyways
        - Bryan
            - on his time horizon, platforms emerged because they solved problems and are built on protocols anyway
            - we're building new protocols but are going to have to build new platforms anyway
            - new cyclical thing on a 50 year time horizon... 
            - tech gods to solve our problems, e.g. chatgpt, (modern age) vs previously thought of divine gods 
            - protocol not that invisible yet not that tangible... doesn't have confidence software can ever evolve to that level 
        - Grigori
            - lens of free speech is incorrect — practically not even dealing with free speech 
            - add short entity pipeline at a traditional company... not a platform 
        - Jenna — listen mode
        - Matthew
            - liked the reading — laid out fundamentals for him 
            - are there any fundamental changes in the rhetoric that have happened in the intervening years?
                - Vgr: sentiment has swung. people would build careers being platform consultants. it's not the villain of the show somehow 
        - Sachin
            - internet equivalent of trad aesthetics — going back to something that used to be good, robin sloan also frames it that way
            - farcaster sufficient decentralization framework -- trying to make protocols work with existing systems (like the big push to make cities walkable — you have to drive there and then walk) 
            - free speech is not solvable through protocols 
            - decentralized network of rapid changes... you can't create great outcomes and adoption 
            - usenet vs reddit description: platforms that exist now are vertical integrations of multiple protocols on different layers. 
                - you have to now horizontally integrate with other industries that solve the same problems for ppl (metaverse, rhea)
                - maybe sufficiently strong protocols don't exist for those
        - Shreeda
            - something is missing right now for adoption... 
        - Venkat 
            - protocol is such a broad concept... handshakes are a greeting protocol, etc. he likes the broad definition 
            - make your definition of platforms as rich as protocol definition but you'll find that there are more protocols than there are platforms 
            - how do you draw interesting platforms around platform, language, grammars, protocol, APIs? they're ways of organizing the instituitonal landscape of social realities  
            - free speech impetus mismatch for this piece... blockchain people talk about it as censorship resistance (which is well defined enough you can design spec it)
            - good orientation piece 
            - everyone wants tokens but no one wants to show up for governance votes... given a voice but not using it 
            - trad thing is a red herring -- new protocols are going to be much more sophisticated. 
            - protocols get captured as platforms as they age — surface reason is spam. a problem you can only solve with massive scale. spam was used as the excuse to capture the email protocol. you get a nice protocol, it gets exploited. someone steps in to stop the exploitation. then it becomes a platform. then platform gets disrupt. then people build new protocols... maybe that's the lifecycle but not super confident it tracks

    - Fri, Feb 10th, 2023: https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2
        - Ananth
            - easy to read & liked it
            - web3/blockchain ecosytem 
                - computers, internet, internet forums / governance mechanisms, layer 1s, primitives / NFT toolings, application layer 
                - how do the layers impact each other?
        - Bryan
            - disappointed it was not a solar system model 
            - don't like the way they categorize the layers -- dynamics of civilization don't match neat layering 
        - Grigori
            - pace and layering --> temporal and spatial dimensions (happens a lot in natural sciences)
            - skyline of a city as an example
            - conflation of space and time should be relegated to natural sciences and should not be discussed by other domains... 
        - Jenna
            - guidance counselors have to help people understand time horizons
            - anything that tries to model everything is wrong but anything that points to time horizons is good 
        - Kiran
            - It made him think of a ribbonfarm post with layers (people, instituitions, markets, ideas)
            - recycling shouldn't place responsibility at the level of individuals --> wrong level of abstraction 
            - the nature of work is the system that interested him
        - Sachin
            - He didn't really like the layer thing — it feels wrong 
                - Depending on the time that you're in, they're moving at different paces; maybe it's more like the other layers adapt to one that is moving the fastest. It's not neat 
                - A new technology that is taking off rapidly -- all technology being an extinction of the senses? A new technology accelerates one sense by numbing the other senses
                - Last 10 years --> a lot of activity in commerce but not changes in infrastucture 
                - Harmot Rosa reading on acceleration (frenetic standstill) — things are moving so fast that there is no change taking place. Lot of speed but nothing really happens or moves forward. 
                - End of History essay — Hegel predicted end of history in 1806
        - Shreeda
            - still new and young
        - Venkat
            - lots of thoughts because he's been thinking about this for a very long time 
            - the part of the model that is wrong is where most of the interesting stuff happens 
            - solar system orbits — unstable orbits that collapse or collide
            - human civilization doesn't operate like this
            - “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen” – Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
            - Some related links https://hbr.org/1997/03/the-living-company
            - Eruptions and change — tectonic and volcanic activity 
                - Pace layers have to collide 
            - why is this model so attractive? clean stacks that miss the point
                - architectural cleanliness 
                - pure arts — music and architecture, pure in time, pure in space 
                - architect pretending to be a musician... 
                - architectural thinking leads you astray b/c in buildings you have artificial control. platonic, clean
                - things you can design vs complex, emergent systems

        - Bryan
            - "Each component of the trilemma comes laden with costs and benefits, so each major international policy regime has strengths and weaknesses"
            - "Note that those were the prevailing regimes. Because nations determine their monetary relationship with the rest of the world individually, some countries have always remained outside the prevailing system, often for strategic reasons."
            - "__But just as no country can do away with scarcity or asymmetric information, none can escape the trilemma (a dilemma with three components), also known as the impossible trinity__."
            - Sovereignty, Ambition?, Wealth, Intellectual/creative freedoms, open borders
        - Venkat
            - governance knobs
                - Attributes: Absence of a BDFL, high-enough muddling through tempo, exit/entry balance of people, level of voice, "friction" in civic processes, voter turnouts, the dictator's handbook categories (essentials, influentials, interchangeables), KTLO...
            - can you have a dictator, can tempo be high enough, can you have free entry/exit
            - interest rate = muddle through
                - low rates = low friction
            - bdfl
        - Matthew
            - interesting that they used examples to explain why certain mechanisms can't coexist with others
            - markets get exploited, institutions get captured
        - Kiran
            - free capital movement being people entry exit
            - fixed foreign exchange rate being social status or credibility of group
            - ind. monetary policy = being able to set long term goals inside the group
            - if you allow movement of people, is there a lot of churn and tough to get social status working?
        - Jenna
            - fast-cheap-good, pick two
            - like the trilemma, not sure about what the push and pull of corners may be
        - Grigori
            - we are going backwards
            - instead of having list of regimes that we have observed, we are trying to solve a problem that says something about governance
            - doesn't appear that this problem can be solved
        - Ananth
            - optimization problems in engineering
            - milton friedman, against going off gold standard
        - Sachin
            - trilemma of governance seems too broad
                - gets abstracted away too much
                - trilemma of specific things within governance might make sense
                    - BDFL trilemma
            - common knowledge is important, probably a vertice
                - makes coordination and alignment easier
                - more interestingness
            - inventories not identities
                - how individual identities play into governance models
                - IDs specific to contexts, "identity stacks"

2. https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest 
        - Bryan 
            - there is really no escape — how do you live outside of any surveillance mechanisms? there are really no stateless frontiers anymore
            - stateless crypto stuff is interesting in theory but a little immature 
            - his fav part of a lot of crypto tech --> the state has to say yes to neoliberal ideal of freedom 
        - David
            - He lives in Italy and sees this play out — what tribes are becoming stronger in the online conditions? 
            - are we seeing an evolutionary process in AI and that strategies of being human won't be effective for long? 
        - Grigori 
            - the book review struck him as very arrogant: the tone of the article, e.g. consider the claim that the valley people know enough about the hill people — you'd have to approach the hill people who don't want to talk to you at all
            - convergent evolution of ungovernability --> 
            - second article is a metaphor for hill people.... digital barbarians. 
        - Jenna
            - culture of going to the beach as a glamorous thing is a recent invention. previously, pirates lurked there and it was a dangerous place 
        - Matthew
            - there's a bit of comfort in the fact that people are always trying to escape --> our particular contemporary era isn't the only one dealing with these dynamics of voice and exit, etc. 
            - connection between barbarian mode and goblin mode. taxonomy of digital ecosystem
            - 
        - Sachin
            - made him think of a bunch of other readings — deluze and striated vs smooth spaces. states do the thing of making smooth spaces striated 
            - 4chan is not barbaric... maybe it was a smooth space at one point 
            - nobody wants to be a full barbarian
            - migrants have a high degree of non identifying with national identity.... anything with indian identity is a late 20th century construct. any kind of striation is top-down and more modern 
            - top percentile income in their own strange countries make the best developers. underrated barbarian culture. good engineer, have a starlink 
        - Shreeda
            - ideas of legibility 
        - VGR
            - hill people --> fiction and stories and mythologies happen to be very interesting and don't fit into canons of valley people 
            - he doesn't think there will be a lemon market or the particular remedies she suggests are that compelling

            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience 
        - Bryan: 
            - table 1: non-instrumental vs instrumental 
            - his prior understanding of civil disobedience was much more individualistic 
            - what has to happen for something to become instrumental? 
            - there are two meanings of civil: be polite in a disagreement, but also Civic duty that people have 
            - when does civil disobedience become a militant disobedience? 
        - David: 
            - so much study of governance isn't empirical – waiting for dataset to validate the model 
            - actors and protestors might not be fully rational beings (obviously the case); he thinks the paper isn't accounting for human nature of optimism
            - protest tactics that piss people off (rebellion, throwing paint on paintings); reframing the space of what is possible
        - Grigori 
            - crowd disobedience is a dynamic situation 
            - you have to also take into account the rationality of the power group / state / leader
        - Jenna
            - same point as bryan about individual rule breaking 
        - Kiran
            - being indian, you get introduced to it early-on in life
            - put more nonviolent civil disobedience into context
            - for every civil disobedience movement, there's a corresponding violent one
        - Sachin
            - is this an ealry to mid 20s model that is not successful anymore?
            - people are more atomized, so how do you coordinate on a large scale? they're not successful anymore 
            - successful civil disobedience movement needs to be co-opted by an organization that can help them
            - it's more coopted as cyncism as ideology (zizek)
            - bjp party... also a failed disobedience movement
            - are there recent examples? cynciism as ideology civil disobedience 
            - model disobedience: too much symmetry of information..... either be cynical leader (you're sticking it to the system) like elon or trump (admit to being morally fraud person who is cynical) or you're like Mishima (committed sepoku, symbol for japanese new right movement)
        - Venkat
            - civil disobedience is not actually bounded rational, it's actulaly super-rational
                - it adopts a rationality that is larger 
                - information about the leader to be revealed: either weaker than he looks, or deep-state type of archetype (too harsh)
                    - in either case, you force a change... they quit, they're removed by military or democratic voting
                - creates a common knowledge cascade --> foundation for governing narrative changes 
                    - yet it doesn't explain most attempted civil disobediences 
                    - there's a level of modeling and analysis beyond revolutionary change 
                    - the paper is trapped.... point that thoreau makes
                    - “One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate, penalty?”
                        - states are incapable of answering questions of their own moral legitimacy --> the state itself could be irrational 
                        - sometimes it's not just revolutions. there's a whole narrative shift. 
                            - you can swap governments thru revolution but it might not change the narrative
                            - the planner wins if they can move the equilibrium of the governing body's philosophical narrative
                    - current spheres: climate, blm (what is the fundamental narrative shift they want?)
                        - shift the moral authority narrative from neoliberalism to degrowth 
                        - blm: what is it beyond civil rights movement stuff from 60s? 
            - threaten the legitimacy of the governing narrative but doesn't spurn aggression 
            - if you react in an extremist way, that leads larger group to question their loyalty to their state
            - trump led a civil disobedience movement by breaking a lot of informal norms and guardrails of american democracy 
                - emergent virtual leader... him + pepe people etc

        - Selected reading:  https://minervawisdom.com/2020/03/26/carl-schmitt-and-the-concept-of-sovereignty/
        - Responses: 
            - Bryan
                - he sees the reading as a narrative of sovereignty as opposed to something that would be more interesting to him
                    - he would like something more instructional — how to wield sovereignty; suggests something more anthropological
                    - people pretty much ignore laws
                - Mafia has been intertwined with the government; organized crime gets license to operate sometimes — organized crime is the de facto law enforcement
                - sovereignty and agency? are they the same?
                - Magna Carta: the common people have the same rights / rule of law; that has granted us all freedom
            - David
                - he got three things from the reading 
                    - he believes political communities come together not through their institutions but primarily b/c they have a common purpose and are necessary to kill outsiders
                    - sovereign idea 
                        - not empirical 
                        - not an evolutionary dynamic
                            - brexit: a failure to understand how european instititions are embedded in british politics 
                        - international systems are there primarily to protect the strong 
            - Sachin
                - punishing the enforcer of the law, reminds him of the texas abortion law where you can sue clinics in violation and get 10K
                - you can see quietly making exceptions in a lot of corporations 
                    - quiet-quitting; making an exception without consulting a higher authority
                - when moved to US, he thought it was weird that suburbs have sidewalks but no one is walking on them; in India, infrastructure was broken but people were still walking anywhere
                    - maybe people are not cynical enough today 
            - Shreeda
                - is it actually dictatorial?
                - governance coming across from a state of exception 
            - Venkat 
                - Schmitt is something that's referenced in a lot of articles
                - dissonance between reality and the model — how does it effect how you should think about it? 
                    - more people comply with the model of politics in a ceremonial sense even if they don't sincerely believe in political rhetoric
                - the power to make exceptions needs some nuance; almost like a risk management exercise
                    - worry about your right to make exceptions and who has the right to enforce punishments 
                        - representatives of the state who enforce punishments
                        - the mob — can police your right to exceptions
                        - self-appointed busy bodies; e.g. karens 
                            - axelrod (norms are strongly founded if people take on the role of enforcing the meta-norm) 
                                - punishing those who decide to not enforce the norms 
                - who gets to make the exception vs who gets to openly make the exception
                    - everyone gets to break rules here and there but very few people do it very openly 
                        - cynicism (https://nosubject.com/Cynicism_as_a_Form_of_Ideology) is more closed 
                        - who gets to openly flout? 
                            - actual monarchs (ceremonial outlaws)
                            - outlaws (spaces where the police don't dare to go, e.g. the mob. beyond the frontiers of what is claimed)
                            - january 6th; open sedition (you feel like you're powerful enough; current state of governance gets discredited)
                    - narrow view of schmitt — only take people who can legally make exceptions seriously; but most systems aren't that tightly controlled. 
                        - the median system has enough people capable of being in violation
                    - people take the model view extremely seriously as a normative prescription
                        - people hope that there is a monarch for repairing the system
                            - opens the door to totalitarian models of governance
                            - moldbug etc people go down this path
                    - We should read something about the theory of civil disobedience. Gandhi, Rosa Parks etc. When people make a calculated judgment that the law can be safely challenged.
                    - surveillance state makes exceptions a lot less viable 
                        - every act of exception will become an act of civil disobedience

        - Selected reading: News from now here; most and least important moment of 2022 
        - Prompt: 
        - Responses: 
            - Jenna
                - what is the long now doing with this piece? why are they publishing it? who is this person? 
                - pointing at something interesting but obvious
                - most / least moment
                    - most: january 6th insurgence; a fruiting spore of collapse (even though it was 2021)
                    - 
            - Kiran
                - it was a confusing piece — prefigurative politics was defining it
                - before you have a lot of followers on twitter, you have to act like you have a lot of followers on twitter 
                - future is not 1 to 1
                - most and least moment: 
                    - most: also jan 6th, but also the war
                    - least: saudi beat argentina 
            - Shreeda
                - OODA loops (Such an unstable, open-ended political environment makes it hard to sustain any fixed notion of future accomplishment.)
                - There are many alternatives (Utopia is not held up as “the end,” but can be invoked in order to assert the possibility of different alternatives and the revolutionary openings these may involve, the advent of a radical alterity here and now. )
                - Interstitial process / muddling through (The only possible way of conceiving revolution is as an interstitial process that involves the creation, expansion and multiplication of cracks)
                - Prefigurative politics and shifting nature of how time works in today's politics / social media / there's a new narrative often 
                - most / least important:
                    - most: 
                    - least:  
            - Venkat 
                - he liked it and thought it made some non-obvious points
                - unambiguous emotional disposition --> the non-obvious point
                    - the affective disposition towards the future; what emotions do you have about times other than the present? 
                        - hope vs despair (future); primarily an emotional mood then you have an intellectual context
                        - what happens when you subvert that idea that the emotional vibe has to be a coherent one? 
                - future is unevenly distributed (more obvious point)
                    - practicing the future doesn't necessarily invoke it; causing the future you desire is not the same as living it
                - most / least important moment: 
                    - ukraine conflict --> a moment of resolution never arrived; the moment that didn't happen (in terms of broad global consciousness arriving)
            - Grigori
                - the article was hard to read
                - there are different dimensions of now
                    - reflecting on the world cup
                        - project the future from right now or the general trend from before 2018/2020 --> two completely different fields/pictures
                        - this can be one of the definitions of a revolution; something happens and there's an inflection point. you're uncertain of whether you should go back to the previous trend or make something happen from where you are right now
                - most / least important moment: 
                    - ukraine conflict

    - Humming Part 2
        - Matt
            - managing exceptions instead of the typical case
            - strength of disagreement is more important that the number of them
                - strong objections are against consensus
        - Jenna
            - underlying assumption that there is a best technical solution
                - if you know the best exists, why do you have to find consensus
            - watership down, rabbits decision making
                - suddenly group makes a decision and they start moving in the same direction
        - Kiran
            - outcome driven nature of IETF helps how they govern
                - most online communities don't have to worry about making the right technical choice
            - bringing along as many people as possible
            - if you aren't outcome driven, how does that change governance?
            - vote stuffing is harder to do face-to-face
        - Venkat
            - thinking about IETF more as judiciary
                - preventing the tyranny of the masses
                - not quite judiciary
                    - judge in court room follows due process principles
                    - if court is unable to reach conclusion within it's paramaters, the judges just make something up
            - what happens if chair makes poor judgement call on technical matter
                - often have forks, where subset of group splits off and tries to make a competiting alternative in the marketplace
                - IETF is a monopoly
                - judicial process where questions are raised to the marketplace to decide
        - Grigori
            - purpose of humming is to raise relevant issues and then address them
                - that's why it happens at the start, to uncover issues
            - doesn't really resolve main risks of thee methodology
                - people come unprepared, don't see/understand the issues
                - chair doesn't follow procedure, what seemed to be consensus in actually invalid
                - chair used power to mislead the group
                - participants have doubts, or have reasons to remain quiet

            - I don't know much about IETF, but assuming it doesn't make sense to fork it, so it doesn't have the same sorts of schisms that tend to develop in OSS
            - consensus requires faith in the institution
            - coersion in the face of consensus
        - Matt
            - Could technical power / political power / market power form something like an iron triangle?
    - On Consensus and Humming in the IETF
        - Grigori
            - definition via negation
                - what __cannot__ be said?
                - dealing with people who don't want to vote but vote anyways
            - all about power structure, not decision making structure
                - the chairs have a lot of power, play a lot of power games
        - Kiran
            - "in the quest to avoid" they ended up with all three
            - majority is starting point, not end
                - looking for places to continue conversation
        - Matthew
            - how do you build in correction mechanisms to catch errors early?
            - governance by explicit mechanics vs governance by vibe sampling
            - this fails in an interesting way
            - testing for consensus
                - contemplative practice tools that explicitly designed to understand the assumptions that you have
                    - what's the collective equivalent of that?
            - rough consensus and running code not easy
                - requires both technical and social proficiency
                - cannot be transplanted into different contexts
                    - brand new group couldn't pick this up and run with it
        - Sachin
            - getting rough consensus feels like the job of product manager
            - equivalent of a hum in meetings
                - raise objection -> lets take this offline
            - how was it when people were working IRL together?
                - online interfaces don't provide affordances for hums and subsequent discussions
                - no way to build top-down alignment in an org w/ remote company
            - echo matthew's point re:meditation
        - Venkat
            - IETF has lived through a bunch of historical-technical events
                - important point, they are successful org
                    - maybe moreso than w3c and eth governance
            - comparing and constrasting to large corporations, since IETF is one of a few orgs of it's type
                - most corps have condition of bureacratic capture
                - in practice, corps are governed in ways that looks like this
                - intel has been captured, amazon still run by king
            - IETF is form of legitimate bureaucracy, it's designed to be a bureaucracy
                - they think capture is a good thing, and the threat of democratic capture looms large
                - democratic tendencies do so with ignorance of the rough consensus mechanisms
            - diff from informal democracy
                - hum start of convo vs. end
                - matters of principle vs matters of taste
            - healthy document within healthy tradition
        - Bryan
            - a lot of this comes down to expediency
                - asking for objections instead of opinions means you can move on
            - also seems like the most successful people I've encountered are the ones who have pointed objections but otherwise go with the flow
            - trick is avoiding the "looks good to me" culture or worse "do what you want"
            - second order hums
                - getting people to acknowledge objections raised by others that they hadn't considered
                    - especially present in multidiscipline groups that defer to a particular individual's expertise

    - Great Founder Theory
        - Bryan
            - yeah duh airport management book vibes
            - lots of founders actually don't do a good job and/or build something that's not great that still somehow succeeds
                - also what about when founders sell or otherwise rescind power to someone else who continues building and maintaining the thing
            - author seems to be focused on pattern matching the last century's leaders, but what would he say about the emergence of the BDFL archetype?
            - author seems to think that everything is high stakes, all or nothing
            - leadership in military an sport?
        - Grigori
            - suprised this topic is still discussed
                - in his part of the world, War and Peace helped settle this 150 years ago
                    - great men are just labels, it's easy to have them, they don't really provide power themselves
                    - https://www.marxists.org/archive/tolstoy/1869/war-and-peace/book-9-chapter-1.html
            - if you dive deeper into his examples (gov, biz, uni), they lose track of foundational principles and people
        - Matthew
            - whats the outcome of the founder-victim mindset?
            - weary of framing around great founders
                - body of institution is standing in the way of individuals are capable of getting the institutional goals achieved
                    - that feels naive
                    - in institutions, there's usually good reason that the brakes have been applied
            - can looking at history become an infohazard?
        - Sachin
            - type of thinking that leads to people believing in SBF-type characters
                - gets proven time and again but always comes back
            - great founder theory leads to less technological development?
        - Shreeda
            - parallel between big man stuff and great founders
                - great founder is aspirational version of big man
            - institutions don't follow evolution...they lack memes, etc
                - how buildings learn...maybe there is mechanism for evolution
            - his idea of institution is different from fukayama's
                - FF describes it as extension of military states
        - Bryan
        - Venkat
            - Copying over my page of links on [[Straussian]] philosophy in case we want to read more on that, it's sort of the steelmanned version of this stuff

    - What I learned co-founding Vox
        - Bryan
            - What is success?
                - hitting KPIs?
                - Clout and legacy?
                - Mission Accomplished?
            - Appears that they didn't try hard enough and didn't use their imaginations
                - Founding team has all left, why?
            - You can't try to disrupt only part of the incumbent playbook
            - "This was not an important aspect of the analog journalism skillset because editorial staIers had to \ght to obtain precious column inches. In digital, the space is limitless, so it’s generally good to do more."
                - this assumption seems wrong
                - constraints are good
            - how to train people to do performance art vs do a job
            - obligatory "low interest rate" comment
            - no plan, no strategy, just vibes
            - reminds me of nymag in the 70s, hostile takeover by Rupert Murdoch
                - ironically nymag is now owned by vox
        - Venkat
            - interesting on two levels
                - story of media landscape over last 15 years
                    - coincides w/ ribbonfarm arc, the road not taken for him
                    - nothing too surprising, clickbait artists, etc
                - degree to which platforms ended up shaping content strategy
                    - long narrative leads for recipes, etc
                    - writing for algorithms instead of audience
            - convo at Yak C about tech stack and environment we use
                - we feel similar pressures w/r/t to VC backed platforms
                - some time VC/ad-supported biz models have to make more money
                - DAO tool crowd will have to deal with the same thing
            - purely internal strategies don't map onto extrnal environment, you might have to give up on it
            - governance context on strategy
        - Shreeda
            - can't scale a small group's instincts, can't commodify high-quality mission-driven thinking
            - coordination headwinds probably maps onto this too
            - platforms stipulating what content looks like
            - history of 21st century journalism...need a book about this
            - how TED talks have influenced a lot of downstream thinking
            - ending was meh, feels like author is pandering
        - Sachin
            - even if author could've solved their problems, it never seemed like Vox went deep, they just descriped things, would've been disrupted by AI anyways
            - chat GPT reduces the value of thin descriptions
            - thin desc have zero marginal cost, easy to get them via compute
            - platforms changed journo status game from writing for a specific outlet to having a following on twitter, substack readers, etc
            - outlets are the middleman, can be disrupted
                - outlets cashing in with clickbait articles
                - clickbait articles are good fodder for twitter beef
        - Jenna
            - grow or die conundrum
                - if you have to get huge to survive, that's no good
            - things on YT w/ millions of views that you never hear of, remind how massive these platforms are. ideas spread fast
            - inside baseball
                - journos like to dunk on the author
            - don't die, just find ways to survive
        - Grigori
            - issues of governance not discussed, understandable bc author is a writer
                - publications live and die on backs of writers (in mind of the writers)
                - chinese wall between writers and operations (ad sales, biz dev, etc)
                - who is responsible for the business model
                    - writers again think they are, but they aren't capable
            - cannot take biz model for granted in the modern media landscape
                - as soon as you think you have it, you probably don't
            - zero to one
                - rediscovered the difference between twitter and NY times
                - thiel talked about how twitter has huge valuation because of bright future
                - if you look back, twitter goes sideways, NY times has grown
            - misunderstanding of platforms in this article
                - author blames platforms
                    - news orgs were some of the first platforms in the world
                        - because they were the first two-sided marketplace
                        - don't understand why news orgs have forgotten about this, instead blame the platforms
            - story of NY times success is interesting, need to find an account of it
    - Bobos
        - Bryan
        - Grigori
            - you don't have to be right to be famous
            - you only have to be right from time to time
            - if you want to be exemplary bobo, you have to be clear and make a point with viral properties
            - jobs of pundits like David Brooks are gone
                - NYT still exists, some columnists are still well known, but there are only dozens of these people anymore, not a whole class
        - Kiran
            - excerpts seem out of touch 20 years later
            - bobos are a middle class, the stooges of the true elites that don't have to play by the rules
        - Sachin
            - brooks paints a version of reality that he doesn't experience
            - preserving their reality even if things have changed
        - Venkat
            - if you write long enough, you'll end up writing more than being right
            - never even interestingly wrong
                - if you're going to be wrong you want it to go some place interesting

    - [An Exploration of Internet-Native Organizations](https://www.forefront.market/blog/internet-native-organizations)
        - with special guest Scott Moore
        - Scott
            - doing work in web3 since 2015-16, around the idea of decentralized companies
            - built project inspired by work in machine learning, feeding contributor results from orgs and distributing equity between organizations to create founder collectives
            - DAO hack happened, nobody talked about daos for a while
            - merged his project with Kevin's Gitcoin
                - open source repos as original digital organizations (cathedral & bazaar)
                - how do you fund open source software
                - quadratic voting became lucky guess at how to do it
                - started doing bounties
                - democratic ways of signalling support for projects in particular communities
                    - works better in ethereum than trad science research orgs
            - april 2021 Gitcoin became a DAO
                - still learning
                - hard to go from having a large audience to having a large community
                - Orbit Model
                    - bringing people who care about a project into a position with more pull
        - Grigori
            - in many parts of article, it sounds like it's trying to find the opposite of traditional organization
                - people were fed up w/ corporate culture and decided to go in opposite direction
                - sounds like it was easier to implement and explain to people by going against traditional ways of organizing
                - people might be fed up with org politics, but they are comfortable with them
            - "leaders in DAOs are just people with more context"
                - but what about the power?
            - "everyone is a leader"
                - but what about accountablility?
                - delivering on the promises?
        - Jenna
            - "DAOs were envisioned as having automation in the center"
                - our experience: automate things that can be possibly automated but no more
            - hyperstructures, collective intelligence was interesting
                - https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html
            - questions for scott's experience
                - own experience, what's the ideal size?
                - how many prime commitments can each person take on (number of DAOs)?
                - when bounties were big last year, how much drive by activity does that draw and how much of a problem is that?
        - Shreeda
            - "alignment stronger than structure"
                - reminds her of thesis of YC: token governance not working, soft consensus is better
            - who is a leader in a network, and how is that derived from context?
                - who takes on the context wrangling?
                - BDFM
                    - how much bandwidth does anyone have to take on the context wrangling
            - learned helplessness in trad orgs?
                - where does that come from?
        - Venkat
            - YC comes at this from less of practicioners POV, we are hobbists
                - Gitcoin is successfully scale example, is also a very narrow scope
                - how does scope effect what success and it's measurements look like
            - context is available for the taking in online organizations
                - Oliver King did this in YC, contributed effectively because he could grasp the context or figure out who to ask
                - why doesn't this happen more often?
                    - biggest energy shortfcoming in YC
                        - lot of good effort for participation, but project management and coordination efforts on project timelines makes it more difficult
                        - it takes time, also a thankless effort
                            - hard to do it for the short term
                - when BDFM works it's very powerful
                    - longer tenures or tours of duties are increasingly valuable
        - Bryan
            - The more I read these types of things the more it becomes clear to me that they’re actually talking about communes, not communities
            - Or maybe this is a bigger project than they realize, redoing government
            - You don’t actually have to know the lore to be a part of a community
            - You don’t really even need to feel like you belong per se, it’s more of a “am I enjoying this? Could I see myself enjoying this?
            - Often IRL communities (particularly neighborhood level) the structure (ie government) exists adjacent to the day-to-day in a separate apparatus that’s sort of opaque until you get involved.
        - Scott
            - norm evolution definitely depends on what you're trying to do, but aligning on these norms is key (lore does help strengthen norms but may not be necessary)
            - neighborhoods are good from a conceptual POV
                - in complex research-style orgs you have to manage up and down
                - natural structure for a potluck-having / vibing neighborhood is more flat because the general interests of each member are simpler
                - naturally limited in size by being local, 'who shows up' helps set clear boundaries, whereas less organic orgs tend to have to set their own limits
            - gitcoin has stumbled into narrowness of scope, makes building context easier and allows better enactment of organizational purpose
            - structure is bad (but necessary) because you're never spending as much time and attention on the actual thing as you should
            - bounties or small contracts (e.g. w/ oliver) without clear insight into reputation are like sortition -- a random selection in hopes that the person does a good job (selecting from a superset of intrinsic + extrinsically motivated people)
            - consensus is better than voting
                - voting should be a last resort measure (goodhart's law)
                - consensus by humming is good but hard to scale (IETF style)
            - full automation (e.g. hyperstructures) is not generally possible, it comes back to people at the end of the day (we live in the world of atoms)
            - 
    - Thick Descriptions
        - Bryan
            - The Native POV
                - feels like in season 2 we got a little more mature and started appreciating the contexts around our readings
                - If I were in those shoes, with that worldview, what might I do?
                    - I think this is opposite of the empirical, systematic POV we were discussing a couple of weeks ago
            - A lot of our most interesting discussions seem to happen around "menial observations"
        - Venkat
            - Geertz is the only anthropologist he takes seriously
            - Balinese Cock FIght piece

        - Shreeda
            - writing fiction resonates
        - Sachin
            - also read the Balinese Cock fight piece
            - some fiction feels like it falls in this vein
            - falls in the structuralist school of thought
            - Rene Girard might be in here too?
                - cultural symbols. etc

            - Girard is opposed to Levi-Strauss, etc(?)
            - thick and thin of one axis of 2x2
            - thin descriptions have a validity that thick concepts don't
            - thick descriptions feels like a more enlightened way of studying culture

        - Grigori
            - thin/thick distinction
                - case study approach in management
                - you can draw a lot of conclusions from a single case study or event
        - 
        - 
        - 
        - Venkat
            - protocol effects
                - instead of studying effects of law, thinking about the soft laws behind the hard laws

    - [MakerDAO woes](https://www.wired.com/story/makerdao-rune-christensen-decentralize/)
        - Bryan
            - > Christensen says he always planned to step aside once the DAO had become self-sufficient, but when he tried, it was always rudderless in his absence.
            - "unbundle bureaucracy" is more like atomizing bureaucracy
                - what is the appropriate level of atomization?
            - you need leadership, but you don't need management
            - Voting sounds a lot like Meta/FB board w. Zuckerberg
            - > “a real lack of intellectual rigor and consistency” around the concept of decentralization, which has become a cliché used to signpost a general philosophy rather than a clearly defined objective.
            - Everything, everywhere comes down to participation
        - Grigori
            - purpose of the DAO was to govern stablecoin
                - this kind of thing isn't what most people do in their free time
                - analogous to participating in central bank voting, etc
                - hard for most people to wrap their heads around how these things actually work
            - what exactly was bureaucracy being unbundled from?
        - Jenna
            - if any of this is going to be used by muggles you cannot require users to have capacity for abstract thought
            - how do we make sure things stay fair?
            - always about elite capture, except the elites are always fighting amongst themselves
            - article said all DAOs aren't working, but there are examples of smaller DAOs who seem to be working well
        - Matthew
            - similar pattern w/ VGRs involvement in YC, hole if he dropped out
            - mitigation: could you remove random node from the org to test the resilience systematically? then add the node back and remove someone else?
            - decentralization as general philosophy
                - sort of like the hand-wavy way we talk about democracy
                - stickiness of phrases causes a ton of issues, lots of talking past each other
            - failure to get people to vote
                - never going to win against a fight w/ human nature
        - Sachin
            - goes well w/ Kei's prehistory of DAOs
            - started w/ idea that everything can be software protocol, but protocols alone won't solve governance
            - Maker has same gov issues as regular product orgs...hero complex, charismatic leader
                - mentioned in coordination headwinds
            - elite capture
                - cory doctorow retweeted book about clerks that work for superheroes
                - regular people clean up after the elites
            - makerdao list of proposals
                - can't comprehend them without days of review
                - nobody has time to do this, so they don't know enough to vote
                - why wasn't I asked (ftrain piece?)
            - the longer YC lasts the more core people we've amass, could survive an exit from VGR
        - Shreeda
            - members have varying levels of agency but their governance power might not reflect that, leads to low voter turnout etc 
            - how to distribute and package context to the right people in an effective way 
            - why does the founder model work so effectively / why do most successful orgs have such a strong founder presence.... a friend said to me that the job of the CEO is to stay fast to a vision even if other people flap around it 
            - tension between stipulating all this beforehand / DAO design vs enabling organic self-organization 
            - maybe it's something about self organizing systems where a goal is at a higher level of abstraction... swarm behavior maybe works because of the clarity of the goal... DAOs are more like social networks with shared values / vibes but not necessarily super clear goals;
        - Venkat
            - wonder what's happening w/ xDAI and gnosis chain?
                - should be safe
                - on his mind bc of FTX meltdown
            - organizing pattern doesn't matter
                - FTX has same problem
                    - one person with too much unaccountable problem doing unclear, obscure things
            - Maker could be on verge of meltdown?
            - Key weakness is that governance token based voting 
                - could be improved w/ mechanisms
                - but mechanisms could lead to gridlock
                - gridlock leads to a few people doing bad things
                - not a way to make governance tokens work
                - ethereum gov is NOT, will never be token based
                    - requires social consensus
                    - eth foundation plays honest broker
                - amazed that it has been working for so long
            - been sitting in on EF meetings, impressed with their inner workings
                - different set of problems comes up with soft, social consensus
            - should be able to stake tokens and use them for critical decisions
            - more things on eth will get away from gov tokens
            - once the dust settles we should read about FTX case
            - problem of charismatic leaders
                - BDFL framework
                - briefly we tried BDF-month
                    - seems like a good way to get benefits of BDFL without the great costs
                    - otherwise get caught in the pattern of nothing getting done, someone has to force things through
                - role cannot be attached to specific people
                    - BDFM should be a learnable role, anyone should be able to observe  how things work and then go off and do something themselves

            - striking
                - this year, because we started w/ emotionally ocmpelling case studies, we approached the year with a sense of history mindset

                - fukayama's origins
                - welcome, ghosts was a mood piece
                - sense of history is more about sentiment or mood
                    - we have to come to a mood consensus re: how we feel about sense of history?

                - What does the future of institutions look like?
                - How does one begin to understand and think about the behavior of complex adaptive systems?
                - What does "seeing like a network" / CAD look like?
                    - PA perhaps seeing like a network is a multi-verse like series of perspectives. Lots of images overlapping and also distinct
                - Why are institutions and rules even necessary?
        - Sachin
            - Disney call was really good

                - Doing a quick scan of titles
                    - 15+ public

            - Metaphors of seeing a DAO as biological organism
                - in OGS primer, failure modes
                    - do DAOs have tendency to overindex on particular images of organization? (ie organisms, machines)
            - interesting to see that even in progressive structure, they still end up circling back to solve typical organization problems (purpose, mission, vision, etc)
            - interesting that Gitcoin uses seasons to manage the cadence of governance
                - is this common in DAO space?
                - middleground between continuous integration and annual upgrades
                - drawn from new media (TV, video games, etc)
                - if someone comes in midseason, does that change the dynamic? or are the just means of delineating time.
        - Sachin
            - interesting, feels like they're reimplementing how medium-sized org work, but within a different medium
                - work needs to happen, so mission takes a back seat and you end up doing weird things with mission
            - YakC went through a cycle of this initially, trying to figure out a mission, but ended up finding it unfruitful
            - Meme: I just need to align on the goals of the organization

            - having fun assigning level of goblin mode in various modes of his life
                - part of emerging org is being comfortable with things being in some level of goblin mode
            - stateless cities were easier to exist because everyone has same environment and shared sense of reality
                - how do you create stateless org when people don't recognize the same reality?
            - biology analogies idealize the Gaian emergent thing
                - not everything is emerging, some things are just collapsing
        - Venkat
            - gitcoin has good rep as an actual project for doing things
            - article is underwhelming relative to org's achievements (actually powerful mechanism)
            - quadratic mechanism has widespread gov application, very impressive compared to their governance modes
            - steward cards
                - means of counting who is actually involved in the project, necessary for this
            - voter matrix decision card
                - sort of like YakC decision channel
                - if we ever build a voting mechanism, we should have opinions attached...our prompt school can be adapted to this
            - you have to pay attention to things that seem elementary because inexperienced people might figure out weird new ways of doing things
            - algorithmic social scoring is a brand new idea, so there's lots of ground to be broken there...there are no adults in this space
            - echo Sachin's goblin mode...the world is in degenerative state but we still have to figure out how to maintain things
                - a lot of DAO culture is about figuring out when the energy and motivation are low
                - bots and templates and such are about making goblin mode better
        - Bryan
            - there is no such thing as equilibrium in nature...how would you even go about determining the ideal state? It's not like a machine, where man has built it and knows how it should be
            - Blood vessel analogy is poor because there are certain constraints we inherit from nature. 
            - Important distinction re:biology is the bits about transforming ecosystems and continual growth, not some ideal state
            - The stuff about habits is good, especially in goblin mode. What can be done to keep the ball in play? Yak collective is pretty good about this wrt meeting formats, consistency, automations, etc
            -  Participation, not engagement. Engagement feels dirty, like it's about marketing and ignores the fact that organizations should be two way, not one way. Participation should be the goal...are people showing up to hash things out, even if they aren't completely satisfied?
            - Being a Shepard/delegate that's responsible for success feels like it's getting into BDFL mode.
        - Venkat
            - once heard David Allen talk about GTD, researcher in Antartica, built around surviving in extreme environments, if things change there's immense stress. Goblin mode zombies have to do really heavy things in order to survive
                - what kind of workflow can survive not just inner degeneration, but outer degeneration?
                - The Checklist book (by surgeon...missed name). When surgeons are tired, they can't make mistakes, so they use checklists so they don't forget the basics, like washing hands
                - Yak C isn't hostile environment, but is a sort of refuge of burned out people. It's like the greeting sign at Ellis Island.
            - graph minds
                - inspired by Yak C in part
            - marketing isn't a thing you can or should do at DAOs (don't be about engagement)
                - opposite of start-up...it's a 'don't shut down' state of being
            - inviting people to join graph mind sounds like joining a cult, but people find their way into graph minds and discover something fruitful.
            - people stumble upon the boundaries of YakC and the automated processes work to put you in the proper place
            - like translating something and the immune system not rejecting
        - Sachin
            - co-CEOs
                - one person can be in goblin mode and another in high energy and they can switch modes to keep riding the wave
                - even in relationships...the adage that together you must add up to 100
        - Venkat
            - goblin portfolios...like a stock portfolio. multiple people can be in goblin mode within a good process and they can overcome goblin mode
            - sum greater than the parts at the bottom level of acceptable performance
                - weaknesses combined is less than a weakness

            - False claims...unclear what the author is driving at
            - starts w/ definition of information came about in 1940s, but then went back to talk about information in 1800s
            - understand things about atoms, institutions, and blockchains, but doesn't see how the author is putting them together
        - Jenna
            - something interesting going on here
            - smart contracts are vulnerable to same things other social institutions/software is
            - non-state things on blockchain. new things will be created
        - Sachin
            - feels myopic...poor understanding of institutions but optimistic view of technology
            - interesting tangents
                - blockchain hardness...replace blockchain with any new technology and the same things can be said.
                - creating incentives w/ technology depends on creating some institution
                - atom hardness...reminds of nakatomi spaces.
                    - you can interpret a space in whatever way you want
                    - community sees it one way, but an intruder can interpret it differently
                        - something is only hard if someone chooses to interpret it differently than the majority
                        - basically what's going on w/ US Supreme Court and Clarence Thomas reinterpreting the institution
                - blockchain has already been institutionalized
                - blockchain is an instrument for techno capital to create power where they don't have power
        - Venkat
            - enjoyed the article...grasping at an intuition that's just beyond reach. makes sense why he's fumbling
            - author works for ethereal foundation
            - not sure this argument re:hardness for any technology is true. there are special things about blockchain that separate it from lithium bateries
            - schelling points...how do you coordinate without any basis for coordination? you basically have to guess or pick landmarks
                - this article is like Schelling points in time...infinite possible futures and limiting it to a more certain number.
            - blockchain code can be buggy too. BUT code that survives is code that gets managed over time
                - TCIP code is 50-60 years old, still has bugs, but it's everywhere and mostly just works for everyone
            - author's hunch is right...AIB is poking at things that the world hasn't figured it out
            - Striated and smooth, nakatomi work well here
                - moving in smooth space is more expensive than a striated one.
        - Bryan
            - Hardness vs. Antifragile
            - Random code on GitHub isn't very hard because in 20 years, you won't be able to pull it down and run it. the code might be valid, but it cannot be useful
        - Jenna
            - Do you need to be a prodigy to grok blockchain and other new technologies?
        - Venkat
            - lots of things have to be true for institutions to survive, and that's kinda the whole thing that this business of hardness is getting at. with blockchains, the same things are required, but blockchains seem to require fewer things to be true
            - Hardness by itself vs. reusable hard
                - old documents in lost language aren't reusable hard
            - measuring hardness of institutions: longevity/redundancy of core information assets (ie the Bible in Christianity)
        - Jenna
            - Gnosis has release Tabula (a mirror competitor)
        - Grigori
            - struggled w/ interplay between hardness and predictablility
                - has to do with information being fixed at a particular point in time, but that doesn't necessarily seem "hard"

                - research people complain that budgets are eaten up by KTLO
                - firefighting eats up budgets too
                - KTLO as a category is a good thing
                    - means you've got a machine that works and needs attention to keep it working
                    - KTLO = value
            - presence of high KTLO costs means people might not be thinking critically
                - as time goes on, costs should go down because you get better at maintaining
                - "evolutionary end state of commodity design"
            - tension: does KTLO exist because people aren't pushing cost curve down enough? or is it a constrained by inertia?
                - minimal vs bloated KTLO cost as an axis
        - Gender focus on chores
            - chores as pillar of society is a character trait, gender agnostic
            - Die Hard w/ a vengeance
                - cop that does the thing because he's in the place at that time
                - Cop is a backstopping kind of job, just needs to do what needs to be done
            - KTLO as essentialist way vs characteristic perspective
            - 2x2: is it really KTLO or subjectively KTLO?
                - sometimes when people stop doing things nothing happens
                - Yak Coll welcome squad...we tried, stopped, muddling though now but it's absence doesn't kill a thing.
        - Sachin
            - Be Selfish
                - small org, people need to take on chores or other tasks that aren't enjoyable or stimulating
                - regardless of gender, people need to take these things on
                - there are things that people think can be ignored and things will be OK
                    - is it good enough to keep the ball in play?
                    - you don't need to be extensive/details to ship
                    - sometimes you get lucky when you do things like this
                - sometimes people think you need to work more to ship more, but you can ship less by doing what's only essential
                - a lot of things don't matter at a certain scale
            - KTLO
                - depends on the org...tenured ones spend more on KTLO
                - some KTLO work is can just be automated but hasn't, and people have been churning the same tasks for too long. Seems miserable for everyone.
                - some orgs do things w/out a core competency for innovation's sake
                    - they don't get the implication of new thing on existing thing
                - Chesterson's Fence
                    - if you don't know why something exists don't change it

            - - ktlo is often misidentified, maintenance is uncool eg Why I am Not a Maker piece by Deb Chachra
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/
- 2x2... 1 axis needed/notneeded, other axis:  __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ _?
- what actually moves the needle
- work smarter not harder ie wu wei (not really, prolly)
- yc reading list maintenance
- event set up in discord
- yaktweeting events
- prompt school set up
- knack set up
- heat map+newsletter
- welcome new yaks
- rewarming existing yaks
- what is minimum viable community management
- gender divide, prolly
- another piece on "glue work" relevant
        - Grigori
            - mistake to think that innovation and KTLO are opposites
            - sometimes people just want to present the dichotomy to make a point
            - innovation is perceived as sexier than maintenance
            - value of maintenance and value of innovation isn't clearly defined
            - if you know the value of something, then you can use appropriate incentives to get those things done
            - power game dynamic over budgets, resources, etc
            - 2x2
                - innovation
        - Bryan
            - sometimes chores by themselves can be worthwhile
                - in a spiritual sense, like the rebuilding of the temple at Ice Jingu
                - good for introducing people to a particular set of skills
                    - by eliminating chores, do we prevent people from fully developing their skills
            - There's a budget/time/resources aspect
                - big budgets get you fancy KTLO solutions
                - no budgets require cobbled together solutions that just work OK
            - Doing things for the sake of doing them (enjoyable, even if not essential) is OK if you have the resources
                - it's like the high production value Lorecraft at companies. It's over the top but they have the cash to fund those endeavors
            - Backstoppers vs Explorers
                - organizations need both types. too great of an imbalance can lead to status games between maintenance and innovation
        - Jenna
            - nobody really pushes things forward at Yak Collective
            - none of the existing members have the energy...do we need to find people that have the energy?
        - Venkat
            - many things are necessary in a long-term way
                - vitamins (long-term) vs aspirin (short-term)
                - if you continuously do unhealthy things you will destroy yourself

                - Ise Jingu is a giant vitamin
                    - lots of things become determistically necessary when you hold a particular meaning frame
        - Sachin
            - don't see a lot of vitamin-unecessary quadrant existing today
                - corporations have lots of churn in terms of people, so they don't feel like it's necessary to do the long-term vitamin style work
        - Jenna
            - often, KTLO is the wrong word
                - if something needs to happen and needs to be automated, just do it
                - if it can't be automated, then it's maintenance, and don't disparage it with KTLO term
        - Grigori
            - people that actually exercise enjoy it
            - people who don't, usually find it boring
            - apply to maintenance, if you do it the right way, you won't complain about it
            - Bryan: reminds me of backstopping
        - Venkat
            - to Jenna's point about innovation in YC being driven by Venkat
                - you have to constantly be doing little experiments, you just have to realize that most things will fail, and even if it succeeds, you don't have to exercise that option
            - at portfolio level, experiments 
            - if you're committed to continues exploration, that commitment is a KTLO activity
                - if you have a budget and 80% is devoted to maintenance (deterministic KTLO) the rest of the budget should be diversified across experiments
            - "goblin mode for too long will kill you"
            - "I think steadily doing experiments, trying new things, and doubling down on a fraction, is a vitamin at the level of individual experiments but aspirin at the level of the portfolio. It doesn't matter if this or that experiment fails or succeeds but is not doubled-down on as an option, but some yield fraction of experiments must succeed, and some further fraction of that must be doubled down on to renew/grow the org and replace what is lost through obsoloscence/entropy/decay. So at that meta level, "innovation" is a KTLO"
    - The Networked State
        - Reading item and prompts
            - Saw a lot of links that hovered around the creation of new cities, so thought this would be fun.
                - Read a summary of Balaji's The Networked State (https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words%29
                - Describe initial reactions to the idea and any related thoughts. Any strong ideas you like? Anything you, uh, don't?
                - Alternative if you're familiar with the book concept: read Vitalik's review of the above: https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/07/13/networkstates.html
                - Bonus: consider the dashboard of Networked States (https://thenetworkstate.com/dashboard%29 and propose your own (hint: think of one moral differentiator that you could use to organise and grow a decentralised community around)

                    - Talks about failure modes: the nation state's ability to impede network connectivity and slow connection to decentralised communities
                    - How can an individual at a low level trust that there's no commitment or negotiation between nation states and decentralised communities/networked states?
                        - What are the failure modes?
                - Jenna
                    - Doesn't match up with being disconnected via geography, as opposed to malicious disconnection/blocking
                    - The feeling of reality when being connected vs being disconnected is qualitatively different
                        - How does this work when transitioning between on and offline?

                        - Aware that there's a lot of hype around the release, so picked it up as an intermediate read while I was away
                    - Like
                        - Opens the door for questions about the mechanics of nations, states, nation states to a much wider audience and revokes some of the taboo status associated with them
                            - Kinda like cryptocurrency allowed the questioning of the nature of money and the proposal of alternatives
                        - Makes the point that belonging to an imagined community should be opt-in
                            - Not a consequence of chance (who your parents happen to be, where you happen to be born and when)
                            - My own story, Stateless, about coming of age meaning a choice of nation states

                        - The idea of using a single powerful idea to drive larger coordination and divergence
                            - Typical nation states use vague caricatures of nation-ness, appeals to authority or history to invoke commitment and alignment
                            - This is much more immediate, much more felt etc.
                    - Dislike
                        - Geopolitical crystal-balling (liable to make smart people do/say/think dumb things)
                        - In-group or individual tech-media vendetta continuation
                        - Overlooks a lot of the practicalities—and much of the dirty work of governance—at the nation state level (e.g. infrastructure, social care)
                        - Not everyone is a very online person (majority excluded, which constrains success)
                        - Reduces a nation state to a dashboard and a set of metrics
                        - The focus on the sole founder/strongman required to kick it off
                    - My own networked state?
                        - Most of the existing examples are positive—van life, nature-connected or OldEuro-vibe cities, digital nomads
                        - I'd like to see something in service of negatively impacted individuals, packs, tribes, imagined communities—political dissidents, maybe investigative journalists, halfway homes for refugees or migrants

                    - Televangelists (and the modern church?) as an existing example of the networked state

                        - Effective funding mechanisms
                        - Have physical locations
                    - Feels like a watered-down version of Extrastatecraft (Keller Easterling)
                        - Cites the example of broadband networks consolidating in Africa
                    - Different mediums will drive and birth different types of networked states
                    - Special economic zones cited as another existing example of networked states
                    - What is the difference between something like special economic zones etc. and the proposed idea of the networked state?
                        - Why is it proposed as a new idea?
                - VGR
                    - A little bit averse because quite close to it
                    - The vision is mostly wrong, but in an interesting way
                    - The way to interpret is to see the origins of the person proposing it
                    - Reproducing the "main character" energy problem
                        - People only used to high agency propose solutions dependent on high agency
                    - Has a longer history: began with an innocuous Balaji talk at Stanford about Silicon Valley disengaging and exiting
                    - High agency, high power in tech; in larger arena (like media) found himself with voice problems and involved in conflict
                    - Can't solve problems about a certain scope with engineering and innovation only, no matter how powerful, rich etc. the main characters are
                    - Summary why he's wrong: his origin story is a bet on a wrong axiom—everything cannot be solved by exiting and building an alternative
                        - At some point other actors/parties/stakeholders have to be acknowledged and worked with (or, worse case, war and conflict)
                        - At a certain scale, voice starts to outcompete exit
                    - Worth considering as a mind-expanding exercise, despite the apparent issues with the exit bias, reductionism etc.

        - Grigori
            - distinction between rules and models
                - in the past they were the same, but models have evolved over time
            - thin rules v. thick rules is helpful
                - if rules are thick and require interpretation they can't be bent in particular ways
        - Jenna
            - title of New Yorker review
                - it's not why we obey, but when
                    - important to break rules
                    - military disregarding unjust orders
            - are there local things for breaking rules, or are the criteria for breaking rules absolutist
            - if you're a bureaucrat and meet a citizen, the citizen should be able to expect to be treated the same as every other citizen
            - schmidt quote: "definition of sovereignty is getting to decide on exceptions"
            - "radius of predictability"

            - good abbott = BDFL
        - Matthew
            - if we were to ask what the rules of YakC are, what are they? how could they be categorized (thick vs thin)?
            - are thick or thin rules more compatible with lean or fat systems?
                - what happens when combining the different options?
            - strongly implied that rules lag behind culture and norms
                - if that's the case, why are rules established at all?
            - rules are optional that's downstream of culture, not an immutable fact of the universe
            - interesting asymmetry: takes magnitudes more effort to unmake a rule than to harshly enforce the rule
        - Sachin
            - why do some rules last longer?
                - seems like it's because they're based on interpretations.
                - thick rules have stronger believers
            - rule formation
                - a lot of conflict arise when thin rules are applied broadly in order to make things legible and easy to manage.
                - thick rules that turn into thick rules...a lot of hot button issues today are like this
            - radius of predictability
                - on day to day, it's bad because rules are based on other rules who are based on other rules. hard to really know what's going on
                - even if you figure out a rule, sometimes you miss a detail or there's someone else using a different rule so it's tough to know what's going on
        - Venkat

            - lean v fat, thick v thin
                - trying to think about how thickness sheds light on modeling vs rules aspect of reality
                    - rule saying all houses must be painted red
                        - if you want to question the rule, you might nerd snipe w/ color theory, introduce ambiguity, etc
                        - if that rule is interpreted as thin rule, it will have some reference or basis
                        - models are scientific, rules are political
                            - rules can have exceptions, given by dictator-type
            - the anarch and monarch are sovereign by today's standards, but previously sovereignty was only given to the absolute ruler
            - rule of law v rule by law
                - china makes up rules and applies them, and rulers there are above the law, they are rule by law
            - what's the role of the monarch?
                - declaring the nature of reality
        - Bryan
            - Rules help legitimize a state or give a ruler sovereignty, but individuals also benefit from the certainty that rules introduce.
                - rules of thumb, heuristics help people make decisions
                - also brings stability, because people can make maps of the world and use them over and over.
            - What happens when people break rules?
                - both religion and state judicial systems recognize this and provide space for people to make amends.
                - giving that space probably helps citizens buy into the regime. If they didn't have it, they'd be more likely to attempt a takeover
            - Rules for unmaking

    - [The Legacy of Hammurabi](https://law.mit.edu/pub/thelegacyofhammurabi)
        - Grigori
            - comparing rules and models from last week
                - rule is cut off version of a model
                    - we know that we need models, but instead we have rules, which are simplified versions of models.
                    - rules say what to do, not to do
                    - rules make assumptions of inputs and outcomes, wioth a model that describes how in translates to out
                - why is this so?
                    - rules are tools for social programming. todays reading references this
                    - simple structure allows most people to avoid the details of inputs and outomes
                    - don't think, just follow the rules
            - following the rules
                - two types of people
                    - rule followers and rule composers
                    - important to not leave out this detail
            - somebody has to write the algorithms, and they aren't the same people who are subject to the rules, makes space for movement
        - Bryan
            - no mention of blockchain or smart contracts was interesting
            - Is there space for lawlessness in all of this? Not necessarily in a malicious way, but in a new frontier kind of way
            - there will always be people who don't want to interface with rules in the moment.
                - guy sees flower, guy picks flower because he likes it, whether or not he knows what it is or whether its legal to posess
            - excessive regulations - how long do people play along before the scope of automated reg is to omuch of a burden
                - how much is too much?
        - Sachin
            - read a story about a doctor's algorithm for determining whether someone is receiving to many opioids.
                - woman had dogs (dependents) receiving prescriptions under her name, so she was flagged as an abuser instead of an honest user
            - recidivism algorithms for figuring out who likely an inmate is to commit another crime, used to decide lengths of sentence, bail price, etc
                - supposed to remove bias from legal system, but just introduces bias from whoever wrote the algorithm
            - computational law makes law easier to manage the complexity
                - "I did it because the algorithm said so"
            - encapsulated vs sysmetic complexity
                - laws have more systemic complexity than is visible on the surface
                - something with encapsulated complexity better candidates for algorithms

                    - also: printing press, internet, other innovations where there was hyperacceleration
            - Lots of focus on the tools and systems enabling accelerations, not much on the actual people/groups pushing on the accelerator
                - Gutenberg vs. Luther, who made the bigger impact?
            - Could continous motion (without visible forward progress) be the antidote to acceleration?

        - **Impact Networks**
            - sachin
                - network leadership model isn’t surprising
                    - modern companies work in this hub-and-spoke manner
                        - are they decentralized?
                - you don’t hear a lot about amazon’s executive team
                    - clones of Jeff Bezos, with similar framework of thought
                    - they’re network leaders
                - decentralized orgs are different
                    - instead of everyone alignment, if you have network leaders that are loosely aligned but pursuing their own things, that’s a good model for decentralization
                - avoiding authoritative decision making, critical hubs
                    - feels unavoidable regardless of whether network is centralized or decentralized
                    - there are people that, if removed from network, the network falls apart
                    - something cannot emerge from nothing
                - a lot of writing in this space casts hierarchy as a problem
            - Grigori
                - this is pretty obvious by now, yet we don’t do it the way the author describes
                    - applies to a lot of network orgs
                    - easy to read, hard to implement
                - no evidence that hub and spoke to network org is even possible, no examples
                - strong pull in hierarchical structure
                    - if you are top or center of hub, there are a lot of personal risks in ceding authority
                    - multi-hub
                        - every person here feels the same way…not wanting to give up authority
                - There are good hierarchies that do things right
                - if you are undecided between hierarchy and network, nothing good happens
                - amazon isn’t a multihued, it’s a well-functioning hierarchy
            - Dave
                - agree w/ grigori about easy pull to hierarchy
                - always a power curves, someone is always much much better than everyone else
                - written to people who are just going over the basics
            - Bryan
                - it’s not hierarchy vs network, it’s both
                    - hierarchy naturally happens, it should be embraced, and those with authority would be wise to be good network leaders
                - the question is, how do you create strong networks? it seems like a lot of networks are very weak, and therefore not all that useful
                - without hierarchy, you end up with lots of peer-to-peer competition for status, which distracts from the objectives.
                    - having managers creates more of a cooperative-competitive environment
            - Jenna
                - getting booster, impressed by CVS organization
                - agree that there’s nothing new
                - who’s his audience
                    - lots of young people joining DAOs, this is new for them
                    - in that case, this is a nice writeup
                - how do we behave?
                    - doesn’t cover this point
                    - we’re always status seeking, how do you work around this simple biological fact

            - do each of the philosophies tend to prioritize the immutability of different parts of the contingency trio?
            - if you assume that one part of the trio (ie people) is a fixed variable, you get a nice platform to experiment with the other two.
                - systematically investigate how things can be tinkered with
            - constant emphasis on meaning and narrative
                - philosophy of work inevitably degenerates into the same types of debate as philosophy of life
            - continuously surprised by the narrative component of work
        - Sachin
            - wanted to hear more about how much coordination is required
                - scientists needed less coordination, so they communicated less, so the reduced structure works for them
                - Stockton group in the study had low coordination headwinds
            - Bezos: more communication indicates dysfunction
            - working in an office vs remote
                - being present together builds trust, rapport, etc in informal ways
                - remote work tends to be very formal, structured communication
            - coordination headwinds on start-ups
                - as you grow you need more structure and more communication
            - time horizons
                - shorter term "sprints" vs longer term narratives and roadmaps in future quarters
        - Venkat
            - when people give an "it depends" answer, it means that people haven't thought much about the problem
                - but occasionally that answer means the author understands the depth behind the topic
            - article represents good solid research in org theory
                - n=1 experience has low confidence, but this kind of article takes those individual intuitions and solidifies them w/ research
            - had experience in his phd with an advisor that had strong top-down managerial tendencies
            - 2nd advisor was also top-down as a backstop tendency until the student proves that they can drive themselves
            - wrote a bunch of articles as he was learning about management in mid 2000s
                - managed small team in a startup-y environment that was in a larger org
                - a manager needs to understand the type x or y tendencies of their employees and tailor managerial approach accordingly
            - instincts about managing
                - huge part is empathy and attunement, it can be harder to have empathy with people who are demographically and psychographically different than the manager.
            - worked with odesk (upwork) to work on task management tools
                - "hirer managing", big brothers management, very theory X
        - Bryan
            - individual motivation
                - there's a lot more to satisfaction than competence
                    - really a blend of things: the work itself, autonomy, achievement, people, purpose, etc
                - Maslow wrote a theory Z after this was published, talking more about self-actualization
                - People can be type Y, but inside a type X organization
                    - they can cross the boundary as they get worn down by top-down management
                    - crossing into type Y is possible, but requires lots of work and probably different organization
            - innovation in organization
                - been reading Drucker's Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
                    - talks about the necessity of separating innovation from typical operations
                        - innovation is type Y, operation is type x
                - Organization cannot be divorced from function. 
                    - they work together to create ideal working environments

                    - product team was hands off approach
                    - rest of org needed lots of top-down, even those who weren't even his subordinates
                - lots of communication between an individual team and the rest of the org
                - people find ways to become immune to top-down management

                        - by law, rules exist, there are certain people who are above the law

        - Venkat
            - economic side of software eating the world
                - neoliberal era from 1980s to today was the best kind of slouching towards utopia
                - Delong himself is ambivalent to neoliberalism
                    - something broke in 1970s
            - this is economics version of Richard Gabriels thesis
                - all the people who plan beautiful software end up failing
                - people who half-assed the planning seem to take off
                - Gabriel hates his own insight, like delong

                - has huge bearing on economic policy
                - but the stories are still ongoing, so it's hard to say what is and what isn't
            - "production and plenty" is prerequisite for utopia, but cannot be guaranteed.

            - when he talks to people that work in city planning
                - little talk about technology and it's impact on civic stuff
            - anti-trust hasn't been updated to apply to tech cos
                - if it benefits the customer its not anti-trust, good defense against legal system
                - people in politics don't pay much attention to tech so it's tough for them to grok how it actually impacts policy
        - Venkat
            - has anyone read Didion's Slouching for Bethlehem?
                - inspiration for this essay
                - about 60s and 70s California and it's dysfunction
                - worth finding a review
        - Jenna
            - likes tracking the turning points, where things started to go wrong
- Summary of readings 21-22
    - Bryan 
        - Cory Doctrow disney article - lore - governance ideas
        - idea mazes (future reading), Zapatistas article and Northern Syria article 
        - long arc of governance, you have to survive before you have something to govern. 
    - Grigori
        - Dillemmas in general theory of planning - it can be used as a springboard to learn about the future of planning and what they are thinking of planning right now. 
        - would be good to read about planning and what that looks like in the current world 
    - Jenna
        - wishlist: spaced repetition bot to resurface articles and notes that we have to keep them current in our headspace 
        - future reading on non grifty parts of the DAO space and review of those 
            - eg https://www.dorg.tech/ | https://blog.dorg.tech/ | https://docs.dorg.tech/workflows/doing-internal-work#the-swarm
    - Matthew 
        - readings - slide deck about co-ordination headwinds, rock paper scissors (bio reading)
        - potential future track - fundamental governance constraints - extrapolating from the above readings
        - is there an equivalent for modern/complex governance views 
    - Sachin 
        - ise jingu - refer to it a lot in terms of maintenance, and adapting to new conditions, and also applies in terms of preserving process knowledge
        - messi  - feels like how yc operates and to an extend how people in the yc operate on an individual level also fall somewhere on that spectrum
        - future topics
        - prompt school
        - anything else that I've been thinking about - prehistory of some of the ideas we have been discussing, early 20th century -
    - Venkat 
        - Ise Jingu - renewal and long termism being the same problem. Normally you think about it in terms of something for 10K years, Ise Jingu uses the idea of being regenerative. 
        - nobody is doing that type of thinking. corporations think in 3-5 year terms, no one thinks in the 20-30 year terms
        - "wood decays but the idea does not"
        - Rock paper scissors - Hobbesian and Gaian felt very simplistic and perhaps naive, rock paper scissors. what are some non cartoon ways of thinking about evolution 
        - blockchain readings back to this track 
        - historical case studies vs theoretical and conceptual evolution. what are conceptual leaps or technological leaps that create new governance ideas

        - I[ntroduction for Culture shifters](https://vbsd.super.site/introduction-for-culture-shifters)
            - Sachin
                - articulate signals are external if you want to attract external people - projects themselves have articulate goals 
                - and if the project is not able to articulate it then it kind of fails 
                - the metaphors seem interchangeable - funnels and tubes - something can be both a tube and a funnel. Or tubes can accelerate funnels or create new types of funnels 
                - Slower tubes - encourage a different type of activity 
            - Grigori
                - does not apply to all types of scaling 
                - YakC feels like monoculture 
            - Venkat 
                - Cities dont have strong goals and scaling creates optionality
                - During scaling for companies the optionality goes down 
                - Developing an aversion to funnels altogether 
            - Bryan
                - We are good at tubes, we are bad at funnels 
                - People join - how do we direct people towards things that they want 
                - "Ships passing in the night" 
                - Turning tubes into spaces generally fail and probably not a good heuristic 
                - common bias of the last 15-20 years towards illegibility and not legibility. Can metrics be done in a smarter way? 
        - [encapsulated vs systemic complexity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html)
            - when does encapsulated become system - sometimes it happens when the problem is punted down 
            - encapsulated vs systemic - product decisions, the choice seems to be between encapsulated vs systemic complexity. computer vision example 
            - when do microservices run into issue - when there is interaction - and I think there is distrust that is created in a system encapsulated 
            - distrust of encapsulated 
            - systemic complexity - could be caused by heroic actions
            - cities - encapuslate 
            - interactions between subsystems causes enca
            - worrying about encapsulated complexity - time and capital demands, affected by other factors - reason DAOs or we havent run into the problem 
            - Brian 
                - similar to monolithic software vs microservices. monoliths have more co-ordination issues. 
                - lack of local knowledge causes systemic complexity
            - Venkat 
                - complicated vs complex
                - economy is complex - fuzzy boundary
                - jet engine - complicated - clearly defined interfaces
                - optimization -> convex function defined on a complex set 
                - complicated systems are optimizable because their boundaries are defined 
                - if you do complicated systems with fixed boundaries, you are creating time bombs 
                - the perfectionists - book on airbus engine?
                - conways law - product structure will mimic conweys law - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law
            - Grigori
                - if its a two person team, all the complexity is encapsulated 
                - when does it become systemic 
            - Vijay
                - your mental model did not incorporate all possible changes (the interface changes)
            - Kiran
            - Kartik (from chat)
                - Complicated vs complex reminds me of https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy
                - Looking through a deployment lens:
                    - The success of microservices is entirely due to deployment 
concerns. Microservices lean into Conway's Law by allowing teams to deploy on independent schedules. The interfaces aren't necessarily better in microservices, but by existing they turn into Schelling Points. People start to rely on them, and so the people who maintain them start to care about not breaking them.
                    - Vitalik says we should tend to try to encapsulate complexity, but that grants a lot of political power to the people who can make changes inside the encapsulation boundary.
        - [Biodiversity may thrive through games of rock paper scissors](https://www.quantamagazine.org/biodiversity-may-thrive-through-games-of-rock-paper-scissors-20200305/) 
            - 
                - What they have found is that over time, rock-paper-scissors may enable many species to coexist in the same area by cycling in and out of dominance.
                - reminded me of the clueless coming to power in organizations that are extremely large - iron law of bureacracy - In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely.
                - Kropotkin mutual aid - written around the same time as Darwin
                - In a DAO is there any direct competition? or how would it work in the case of a DAO - may be it cycles through to autonomous organization when no one is around 
                - and if survival is not an issue what happens - civilization style governance? just based on memes and culture wars? 
                - impact of local environment 
                - If species A starts to go extinct, she explained, species B might evolve in such a way that A can recover. This idea also works in reverse.
                - “A species doesn’t always have to be the best. It just has to have enough times where it can be sufficiently good that it can weather the bad years,” - muddling through
                - species does not go exist because of just local environment changing 
                - how does it apply to humans?jobs and governance - more power on the side of the individual?
                - what about emergent phenomenon with more conscious intent ?
                - Bryan
                    - cycling of powers reminded of professional sports teams and how they cycle through good phases and bad phases
                - Grigori
                    - Similar rock paper scissors dynamics in management. For example company with three equally powerful founders is not stable. somebody has to run it even if it has three owners. Starts with someone volunteering without explicit competition. another dominant players comes in when the first one makes a big mistake. since the other two have untouched reputation, they see themselves as a stable system. goes on until everyone is a sore loser. at this point competition sets in because of this dynamic. 
                - Kartik
                    - connection: red queen theory. genetically uniform populations are susceptible to parasites. sexual reproduction makes populations more biodiverse within a single species
                    - connection: fermi paradox - we tend to focus on the idea that ["technology implies belligerence"](http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-21-07-09-03-soc) but biodiversity may be responsible for a more optimistic universe 
                    - connection: [core wars](https://gamasutra.com/view/news/22822/Analysis_Corewar__The_Ultimate_Video_Game.php) is designed for 3 kinds of strategies: replicator/scanner/bomber. What does a game/governance model designed for 4 strategies look like?
                - Kiran
                    - viewed mental model of a system as hiearchial with chaos induced. 
                - Venkat
                    - CRIPSR - you can make dna modifications to produce aritificial insulin but it reverts back to its original state, not a stable evolutionary strategy. 
                    - arrows theorem?impossibility of selecting the right candidate in a democratic election 
                    - survival of the stupidest - if they a co-operate in a smarter way could win over the smarter person
                    - lot of interesting phenomenon that happens when we go from two to three
                    - de-desertifying soil is really hard. roots of grass have complex ecosystem specific to a terrain. chances of success are low if its not adopted to a particular area 
                    - other examples 
                - Matthew
                    - Main thing I noticed is that biodiversity/ecosystems science/thinking starts from a point of dynamism and motion, which turns out to be way more robust than other disciplines which start from stasis and stillness. The other thing I was wondering related to the Primer archetypes. Is there a rock-paper-scissors mechanic between them (e.g. does Gaia beat Muddler?), and are there longer-range cycles of dominance involving the archetypes (e.g. does Citadel dominate in wartime, Gaia in times of prosperity)?

The other thing, based on Venkat's mention of instability, reminds me of something related to John Boyd. Deliberately engineered instability gave F15/16 its agility; can unstable ecosystems be deliberately created for certain situations?

            - 
                - Sachin
                    - it seems there already is shared language, culture and metaphors which helped Zapatista do this
                    - the contrast of zapatista vs neoliberalism is pretty interesting. wonder if land reform would have worked in India if neoliberalism worked  
                    - its hobbessian in some way cause global capitalism is the bear
                - Bryan
                    - very difficult for such organization to gain a hold on broader culture
                    - tyranny of structurelessness thing where they went from organizing to being violent 
                    - need a physical reminder that you are working on something 
                - Commits
                    - online orgs have a singular focus on a topic or action. but not beyond that? 
                    - no immediate fallout of collective energy because they are developing relationships with each other 
                    - what would by default globalism that is publicly visible look like? 
                - Grigori
                    - people felt hopeless then they declared war again "global capitalism"
                    - its not enough to get power you have to hold onto the power - and that requires different set of skills

                    - Narmada valley movement 
                    - social movements start with a specific goal (vs NAFTA/vs WTO/vs Narmada Dam) but then they switch to having vague goals such as against global capitalism
                    - to an extend you can say they have succeeded cause they are still alive 
                    - LEIF coalition - goal is to pay Brazil to not cut down the amazon
                    - Last mile distribution of climate incentives is a moonshot level problem. people's behaviors will remain the same 
        - [Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria)
            - another interesting read would be about the catalms
            - The [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty) was abolished. Prisons house mostly people charged with terrorist activity related to [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL) and other extremist groups, and are a large strain on the region's [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Rojava).
            - makes me think about how in poorer countries you kind of stick with the family and friends you have, cause it is in some ways process knowledge
            - most of their ideas have emerged from their own context and not from an external context
            - effect of the french mandate -  led to formation of these regions?
            - makes me think of axis powers and allies as level one chains and the rest of the countries, including third block are kind of like level 2. Where would DAOs be? Level 3 or 4.
            - third block
            - "For a former diplomat like me, I found it confusing: I kept looking for a hierarchy, the singular leader, or signs of a government line, when, in fact, there was none; there were just groups. There was none of that stifling obedience to the party, or the obsequious deference to the "big man"—a form of government all too evident just across the borders, in Turkey to the north, and the Kurdish regional government of Iraq to the south. The confident assertiveness of young people was striking. - seems kind of hobbesian
            - The main sources of revenue for the autonomous region have been presented as: 1. Public properties such as grain silos and oil and gas in the Jazira Region, 2. Local taxation and customs fees taken at the border crossings, 3. Service delivery, 4. Remittances from Iraq and Turkey, and 5. Local donation
            - Grigori
                - you can get centralized as much as you want, but if you have a hostile neighbor then the centralized system kind of falls apart
                - hostile enemy can crush you at any moment.
                - if you want to make a jump to a more powerful system you need centralization of some kind
            - Venkat
                - the continuing existence of conflict shows that things kind of continue the way they are regardless of how governance is implemented/imposed?
                - abstract governance rules exist
                - big data problem - vastly more data
                - they are caught between a rock and a hard place. This is like an ant between two cows and the two cows are backed by two elephants
                - asymetricality of small powers -  people survive regardless, all history will continue
                - think 5000 years in the past and 1000 years in the future. you just have to outlast the big powers
                - idealism exists for 10 minutes every 100 years

            - serious amount of money has to be involved for something like the hold system to exist
            - it seems like nobody is happy with this system or knows why it exists - better system does not exist thats why it exists 
            - Bryan - its a buyers market -  vast amount of talented people 
            - why would you have someone on staff vs augment with freelancers 
            - airline pilots have contract
            - Financial capital is much more concentrated, Talent is a power law, very technical industry 
            - unions have a huge influence 
            - start with non union premises and the most advanced technology available - this is kind of what indie movies do? 
            - DocumentaryDAO - by equipment + use money to buy equipment - lot of money and resources 
            - distribution - netflix - funding models are different and accept the union structure 
            - Lot of industries work in a similar way - people who are the top of the power law curve for whatever reason hold the power and the others are going to be the ones exploited in the system.
            - you could apply it to dating - its not a buyers market

            - Bryan
                - realizing what is a good idea to change and what are things that cannot be changed is a big part of governance 
                - yak collective - comfortable with everything being illegible, takes work to make it legible and there is no reward to making it legible 
                - energy levels of different projects - impressive that we meet every friday. got over the hurdle of having something worth spending time on. On the flip side, having the energy to get the paper done which is a high energy mode is harder. 
                - yak collective has a hobbyist approach that is different from amateur or pro
            - Matthew
                - leaving an artefact/time capsule of your experience 
                - putting pull requests on everything is interesting.
                - Having incentives aligned is needed for something like an "open" approach work
                - tension in the article between doing something vs realizing what is uncontrollable. how big of factor this is is unclear 
                - yak collective: reinforced the idea that non essential things are fun too. 
            - Venkat 
                - this one is written by a low agency rank and file person, who are not as constrained. First instinct was to be slightly bored by it. 
                - never hear this perspective anymore. 
                - For most people most of the things are unchangeable in the world, they see the universe as a spectator sport 
                - 2X2. agency vs constraint. 
                - whats unique about github - the pull request 
                - YC - there is literally no way to make somebody do something 
                - YC is high agency low constrain environment for people who have low to medium level constraints. high agency high constraint - constraints are clear
            - Grigori
                - all the titles are cliches
                - interesting question - what was the process of arriving at this cliche. fitting the narrative to cliche.
                - analyzed whats going on and arrived at cliches? 
                - we have to be careful with what we can learn from our experience, so that we dont arrive at the cliches. We should not fit the narrative of the cliche. 
        - Messi thread 
            - Sachin
                - Messi's style of play has to be complimented with a specific strategy that works for messi. which means other players have to sort of sacrifice or play a different role 
                - Also when messi works - seems like he does the work of 2-3 brilliant players at the same time. 
                - longer he goes in his career - has the charismatic effect - more defenders engage him which leads to srendipity for other players in other parts of the pitch and zemblanity for the opposition 
                - In most organizations there is a need to justify everything you do - exploratory periods are fewer - actual mistakes or things leading to dead ends are not admitted 
                - Messi was sick as a child and had lactic acid build up fast
                - Alexander technique/non judgemental awarness is curative

                - wu-wei 
                - adapting around other players strength - more possible in soccer than other games - how much is it a function of the looseness of the rules 
                - modern war is more like soccer and older war is more like american football 
                - working around energy patterns. - similar to wind in the willows. instead of starting with a goal, start with what you are capable. 
                - where can I walk to that is more effective vs where can I run to

            - Sachin
                - “will post my comments since I likely won’t stay on for the call. I find such trad takes personally amusing since I grew up in a town that was full of small shops and stores that rapidly urbanized and gave way to fancier stores/restaurants, and everyone was really excited about it. I think that’s the primary difference I’ve noticed between the west and the developing world. Growing up in India, you had fewer resources and money but the tempo/mood of the narrative was clearly upward , you could see things changing around you and people were mostly excited for it. While after I moved to the US, I’ve access to more resources and money but it feels like I came in at the end of something and people are nostalgic for something”

                            - new things have high failure rate

                        - to do it, you’d need to 	know the history of NY street food
                - Meredith
                    - idea mazes aren’t something people actively do…seems like people just absorb them

                - Jesuits were good at PR - printing press
                - instance of path dependence - would the jesuits have existed in a place without the other infrastructure that existed around them? right people at the right place in the right time

            - Grigori
                - they had ambitious goals, because it clashed with traditional order they found ways to hide it 
                - The development of the school was very fast for the time in which it was developed 
                - they were very strict most of the time. 
                - the system that made them spread very fast seems unclear. Interested to know more about what happened initially 
                - they used printing press, but it does not follow from the article that competing movements did not use it?
            - Jenna
                - the letters when they arrived - how are the documents controlled, distributed, who decided what to print. internal decision making is unclear 
                - async model - has a lot of writing/documenting involved. would be interesting to see if it comes out as product output in some way 
            - Matthew 
                - first time reading about jesuits was - novel about jesuits??
                - they were providing legibility as a service - emphasis on translating documents, interfacing between different regions, describing what they were seeing. And thats what sucked a lot of people in 
                - royal patronage helped them to get to the boundaries of the empire or liminal spaces between them. wonder how being associated with the state changed it. what is akin to royal patronage that jesuits had?
                - tendency to document --> similar to everything being async by default. 
            - Venkat 
                - went to a jesuit school
                - couple of things that didnt come through -  in the period of printing press -> westaphalia, jesuits were late adopters to this. Pamphlet wars 
                - they became advisers for ...
                - jesuits were good at getting close to the rulers and becoming the consultant equivalents of the time. They were more about political influence rather than religious
                - jesuits - do most of things in the ears of rulers and not talk directly as much publicly 
                - reason they were travellers - complimenting the printing press - preventing the info from getting in the hands of others 
                - they had access to capital 
                - had a lot of local autonomy but not decentralized. big capital played a big role in projects 
                - reasons async communications worked - most of it was about money. Important things went through central authority 
                - they did a lot of predictive processing - send out advisory blog posts 
                - yak school operating more in that mode than we realize. letter writing was much more commmon and frequent. 6 mail deliveries a day. increased in tempo 
                - people spend hours reading and responding to letters
                - adapting to the medium.if there are long time delays you keep communicating hoping that some of it is useful. 
                - lot of military operations have to unfold in radio silence. same strategy. high level autonomy for local commanders. commanders set overall goal, local commanders have smaller goals and they have contracted agreements between them.  similar to how the jesuits do it. overall mission was clear - spread the religions. filling in the details would be not predictable exactly 
        - Commons 
            - Sachin
                - does not seem like it applies to platforms, unsure if it applies to web3
                - does it even apply in terms of governance of cities and such
                - it also seems away from the commons - the way we operate 
                - local circumstances rules apply 
            - Grigori 
                - it does not describe what we have here, it would benefit us if we could compile something along the lines of 8 principles 
                - none of these really apply to yak collective 
            - Bryan
                - probably not much theres something extremely negative that someone can do to harm the common resources we have
                - we have the option of easily leaving 
                - renegotiate when something comes up 
            - Venkat 
                - Elinor Ostrom - nobel winning economist, is at the socialist side of things
                - Amartya Sen 
                - probably all 8 should be spectrums 
                - applying it to public internet - large models scrape the entire internet - but it fails in that too
                - it does not mean that public internet is not good commons 
            - Jenna
                - good guidelines for things that we want to do if conflict comes up 
                - assume good actors vs assume bad actors (Lunar punk??). in cases where there are bad actors - its not tragedy of commons but different problem 
                - https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720/982314638056251412 - commons example?
        - [Bulldozer vs Vetocracy ](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html)
            - having a fixed limit for processes that are put in place - such as the shrine of ise jingu example. The limit should perhaps be more than or exactly one generation perhaps. so that it avoids sociopathic incentives to a certain extent 
            - cases where the vetocratic mechanism is used to stifle something that could actually be more useful with a bulldozer 
            - recognizing when to be vetocratic vs when to be bulldozer is hard - requires
            - Venkat 
                - Fukuyama - vetocracy - anything can be blocked at 6 levels. Effectively the way things get sorted out is people go to the courts and get things settled there. 
                - individual european countries are not like but other governance structures took ideas from this 
                - baramdipity?? there is serendipity but there is an external force that is trying to change to to zemblanity environment 
                - bulldozer thinking - its pretty old, vetocracy is a newer idea. 
                - yak collective bull dozer bias -- DAOs generally have vetocracy bias - DAOs have a knob from bulldozer to vetocracy. system 
                - code management - people went from thinking of code as something that they own to something that is more open/communal, until 5-6 years, the onboarding process for new employees - on the first day you were supposed to push something into production 
                - go from individual vetocracy to collective bulldozer (anyone can change anything), if you are not competent, you may destroy something 
            - Grigori
                - "we have a pretty huge bulldozer in our country" that is fighting against vetocracy
                - it is a 30,000 foot view on whats going in DAO or society, it can be abstracted down to lower layers as well 
                - current state of yc - much more important to find more bulldozers and not to distract by trying to regulate - finding the bulldozers itself is not easy
            - Jenna
                - making a distinction between what regime would I want to live under vs where I myself am a regime or making the regime
                - adjectives - bulldozery vs vetocractic 
        - [The Art of Community](https://reason.com/1972/04/01/the-art-of-community/)
            - Grigori
                - Old book with a different context.
                - A lot has changed, the author's version of community is different from what an antropologist's would be.
                - Not what a community is, but what a community can do?
                    - what are the use cases of a community?
                        - maximizing rent is not an appropriate answer
            - Jenna
                - Sarah Taber's Twitter threads: we need a better understanding of how rural communities work: https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1539438501317513216
            - Matthew
                - mixed-use urban development meme "it's all good"
                - Conception of community as a nested stack that feeds on one and other
                    - internet as stack w/ layers
                        - app layer isn't fixed, constantly moving target
                            - community is the same way. changes as we become more sophisticated and nuanced
                - clear land banking
                    - sit on land w/ assumption that surrounding properties will improve in value
                    - opposite of the author's proposal of land's value being judged on it's productivity
                        - unclear what extent this has played out...seems speculative
            - Sachin
                - The state's high modern view of community
                - Non-places
                    - transcient places where people are moving through but never stay

                - no end to land values because of tech improvements
                    - is uber drivers at airport a proprietary community
                - company towns might be the ultimate form of proprietary community. They're also dependent on technology to exist
            - Venkat
                - since it's from 70s, ask: what extent have these ideas been realized?
                    - this is actually the default
                        - HOAs inside developer communities
                        - Puppet government
                            - homeowners get to govern, but administration is in hands of developer
                        - condos and apartments are even more extreme example
                    - the more you are in a physical integrated environment, the more power the owner of the environment will have
                        - if elevator in high-rise goes out, homeowner is dependent on the government to fix the problem.
                    - the more complex communities have all the amentities that you need. not a company town, but has serendipidous environment
                    - otoh, public communities becoming ineffective
                - company town connection
                    - as you shrink the city scale, at what point does the fact of proprietary ownership make community aspect difficult?
                    - it's not the ownership structure that makes it hard or easy, but technology advancement
                - Bowling Alone
                    - in 60s and 70s, there were neighborhood bowling leagues.
                    - as community unraveled, leagues fell off
                - Tubes and funnels would really strengthen the proprietary community
                - MacCallum's wiki page is interesting
                    - failed contract for seasteading community

                    - people generally don't know each other, but a provacation event can bring strangers together.
                    - governance, private or public don't matter, but how people respond to events matters
            - Bryan
                - Libertarians always simplify these things. A hotel exists in some larger municipality, and is dependent on others for utilities and has to manage relations with neighbors.
                - Transcient communities have an easier time w/ social contracts. People on the move generally behave well, and when they don't you know they'll be going away soon. But permanent communities have lots of petty squabbles and long-running issues that require constant maintainence
                - The sharing economy is built on this premise. Airbnb was started to allow people to improve the productivity of their homes. Zipcar the same for vehicles.

                    - there are just logical optimizations

                    - these things are unique to the US
                    - building materials are standardized and therefore modular
                    - Keller Eastering's Extra-state Craft (?)
                        - about special economic zones around ports and places where people are trying to attract foreign investment (the other end of the spectrum...multinational and geopolitically convenient)
                        - Like airports where people are committed to being there for a longer term
            - Grigori
                - uniformity of the cities is a function of how cities are and also how travelers see them
                    - easier to get lost if a city diverges from common pattern
                    - interesting things reveal themselves in new places over a longer period of time
            - Sachin

                    - some people want to stay in one place, and some want to move around
                    - also, refugees. sometimes it's not a choice
                    - Station Eleven...people stuck in an airport created a community
                    - Octavia Butler and Cory Doctorow have books about enclaves
                - Origin of gov surveillance started w/ driver's licenses, which are then used for tracking people

            - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."
            - [[Frederic Laloux]]
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  1. Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas. https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30
        - 2. The path to success for a platform venture is by no means easy or guaranteed, nor is it completely different from that of companies with more-conventional business models. Why? Because, like all companies, platforms must ultimately perform better than their competitors. In addition, to survive long-term, platforms must also be politically and socially viable.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} **The read** is an article based on the excellent book The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, et al. is here:
                - https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-future-of-platforms/
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  3. Do you need a business ecosystem?
            - https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem
            - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing." 
It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.

        - 9. About Trust and Common Ground.
Given that lack of close connection and established trust, it’s also harder to develop the kind of common ground that facilitates productive interaction. The issues that people care about, the technical languages they speak, their modes of problem-solving, and their goals tend to diverge greatly when they work in different locations, specialize in different domains, and are responsible for different outcomes. It’s particularly challenging to bridge the gaps in understanding if they don’t know many people in common. The less employees know about each other’s motives and knowledge bases, research shows, the less inclined they are to share knowledge with each other. This can lead to more mistakes, slower project completion, and, in many cases, less innovative outcomes.

        - {{[[DONE]]}} 10. A read on Valve recommended by [[Oliver King]]
Hey Grigori, I was inspired by our chat re: GitLab and wanted to offer you the Valve employee handbook -- they're completely decentralized and self-organizing:
http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf

To keep rhythm and set the stage for discussion: a case study of organizational first principles. Please read the first article, feel free to skim the second for more color:

1. https://corporate-rebels.com/morning-star/
2. https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers

Prompt:
- In an ideal world, how would you like to be interacting with the Yak Collective in two years?
- Are there any first principles you think we should be operating from?
- As far as the meta goes, what do you think our priorities should be? What are blockers?
        - {{[[DONE]]}} 13. A surprise read:
Today read may come as a little surprise. It is the most recent annual letter to shareholders, by Jeff Bezos.
https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
The prompt questions were:
            - How can we create value for people involved in The Yak Collective, potential clients, society at large?
            - Have we created something -- an idea, a process, a memorable phrase, a ritual, an artifact, ... , a bot, -- that can have lasting power, i.e. something that we will be able to refer to, say, 2, 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

            - Is it possible to create non-hierarchical social systems for humans? Power Distance. Lowest in Nordics, Israel and highest in Arab, Southeast Asian and Latin America. "Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modes that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice." "  one context in which a structureless organization can work; a very small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds" "Medieval Iceland from the [tenth to thirteenth centuries](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html) was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police. It lasted longer than US" "Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries" __Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?__ Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (“communication is only possible between equals.”)  One of the observations in __Wealth of Nations __is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we don’t have a solution to the problem of __preventing __them from emerging. __By default __an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. **When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just “is this a system I’d want to live under today?” but “how effective __will t__his system be in the __future __at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?”**
