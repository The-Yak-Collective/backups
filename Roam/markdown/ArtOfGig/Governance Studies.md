- We meet every Friday on Discord Chat at 9 AM Pacific to read and discuss a short reading relevant to online governance. We have multiple reading tracks each with their queues, which you can find below. 
- For the 2021-22 season, we have 4 active tracks with active queues: Nature and Long-Term Thinking, Case Studies, Technology, and General. Please feel free to add links to any queue (preferred), or in the Discord ogs channel using the `$readingadd` command. The Discord list is used as an inbox/buffer and is periodically cleared and moved here.

    - Childbearing, monk hood and sons of the soil
        - [Eunuchs in the forbidden city ](https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/2155959/forbidden-city/life/chapter_02.html)| [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1228372439541481564)
            - Sachin
                - parallels to bureacracy in the present day. Bureacrats are not sexualized at all. You could say from any language even if you dont understand the language 
                - same with workers who are encouraged to freeze their eggs (Facebook program) while CEOs taking maternal leave or bringing their babies to the IPO is celebrated 
                - bouts of extreme anger -  not represented in fiction that much perhaps - they are all shown as calm and restraint - game of thrones 
                - also a disadvantaged group in some way even if they were powerful
                - they were separated from the bureaucrats
                - also played the role of archivists  
                - https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/2154046/forbidden-city/life/chapter_01.html - follow up reading 
                - forced monk-hood
            - Ananth
                - Eunuchs were contributing to child bearing but indirectly 
                - gruesome read 
                - seems quite prevalent in other empires 
                - it was common in India 
            - Matthew 
                - Eunuchs are the shadow for a monk 
                - They are focussed on their own interiority - monks 
                - Eunuchs are focussed on increasing other people'e agency 
                - There must be a really big impact on the culture of so many people changing how they look and how they move 
                - not clear how much influence they have 
                - They are invisible human agents 
                - Fantasy series called Malazan Book of the Fallen similar group of people in it 
                - they are similar analogies in Butlers and other roles - and they are replaced by invisible machines 
            - Venkat 
                - Islamic empire - Eunuchs played a very similar role 
                - In a lot of examples, it was voluntary - they did not have a lot of options so they chose to it 
                - along the margins you would find things that were coerced but under immense stressors or incentives 
                - Interesting that they were unable to have children but they wielded secret power 
                - may be we should read about egypt/islamic eunuchs in goverment 
                - Clans are kinship based, when the eunuchs retained power they became powerful clans 
                - May be we should include the monastic order in the governance track - functional claims are the same 
                - in india - in the muslim era the castratri are similar to eunuchs 
                - witchcraft - is that
                - Harem origin story - you wanted general adminstration to rest on people who would not start clans of their own 
                - Throwing sheep in boardroom - history of relationship between nobility and monkhood. The second and younger sons of nobility went off to become monks. They still had power ambitions - on the ways they controlled power was basically controlling when the royal family can have kids -> reason why catholic church has so much land 
                - Were eunuch allowed to own property and how rich did they get?

                - Full-on biological underpinning via "embodiment"... anything we use becomes a felt extension of our bodies. Land falls into this

                - Example of gulls in *Finding Nemo* embodied this idea "mine, mine, mine"

                - humans always
                - police being called to restore order - they always become more violent. Parallels to the current moment of college
            - Ananth
                - seems like an unnarrateable situation
                - tension between people who are left behind post independence in messy bureaucratic positions and the rest of the population with new political power 
            - Venkat
                - Frames in which it is relevant - Israel v Gaza and southern border
                - Historical exception narrative
                - Definitions and coding need work - has there been migration trigerred conflits since 1980, seems a bit too narrow perhaps. If you code it liberally then all conflict is in the same mode
                - knob should be either more liberal or there should be bands of it
                - band 1: recent conflicts, state sponsored
                - band 2: more long term, historic migration
                - how people come to see themselves as sons of soil
                - Three generations is probably what it will take for sons of soil politics
                - communities putting down roots, States where this least basis for sons of the soil is where its strongest in the US
                - language and number of different dialects in a place is a good indication
            - Sachin
                - Settler politics favor rural to rural immigration perhaps rural to city immigration would not produce as much conflict
                - poor resources on both sides leads to civil war like situations
                - interesting how there is low level conflict for a long time and then suddenly there is huge violence

            - Jenna
                - tai chi connection
                - once you had people who could do other things it freed up time to things like going deep on tai chi
                - difficulties that retirees and FIRE experience when they get to their goals - because we 
                - Being rich makes you messed up 
                - Iron cage similar to Kafka Index 
            - Venkat 
                - Reminded of Academic culture 
                - Tenured faculty and Adjunct - adjuncts do the bulk of the teaching (they are "serfs" with no hope of tenure). modern Adjuncts are captive to being part of the university 
                - similar to the Lay Brothers - they got gaslit into being serfs
                - its not so much iron cage of bureacracy - if you live productively then there is a surplus and no idea what to do with surplus. 
                - Is there a way to create a system of rules in such a way that you are always not able to follow all the rules 
        - [Performative Acts and Gender Constitution](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1650/butler_performative_acts.pdf) | [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1238520235586359356)
            - Sachin
                - Gender has having historic context seems like a reasonably simple idea - not sure why its controversial
                - It seems like there is an enforcement of gender that is similar to enforcement of being a monk or a eunuch 
                - Preventing kinship vs encouraging a certain type of kinship - this seems like a through line in both 
                - Ursula Le Guin stories - I think she has a couple of short stories where the gender of the person is assumed only for some time 
                - Reads like Deleueze - post modern 
                - almost seems anti-memetic in some way - cant tell if the person is serious or not

                - Growing up as a woman was pretty bad but has improved vastly... or has it
                - Agnes Callard being parodied - seems like there is no way to have a conversation around this 
            - Ananth
                - seems like there is discrimination based on gender - based on previous studies
            - Venkat 
                - For some people this reads like the unabomber manifesto 
                - interesting to see even Butler's poltiics seems older 
                - State takes over the psychological function of being the parent of the child 
                - There is some movement in some eastern state where there is a movement to ban home schooling 
                - Reproduction -  who controls it - throughline in all the readings 
                - how do you make political alliances - that is what matters here the most? 
                - There is no benefit of doubt cause both sides try to undermine scientific questioning of this 
                - Groups in the middle try to not talk about it entirely - minimum they need to 
                - On the two extremes - its just war room strategy -there is a pre-determined truth and no one has any doubts on the science 
                - There is no possibility of scientific study on this 
            - Mike 
                - just joined the yak collective 
                - could not find a connection to the non-contingent facts of physical reality. Physical reality imposes limits to the performance in certain way - like the set or props that an actor has available to them
                - divorcing physical reality makes it hard

        - Sachin
            - Cynicism,finally, works to both reduce and reinforce action participation depending on whether it goes together with perceived unfairness (Klandermans et al., 2008). The least active are those who combine political cynicism with the feeling that they are treated fairly; the most active are those who combine cynicism with the feeling that they are treated unfairly.
            - The first social structural characteristic is permeability of the group boundaries,
the possibilities perceived by the individual to attain membership of a higher status
group. Permeable group boundaries allow disadvantaged group members to leave their
group for a higher status group, whereas impermeable boundaries offer no such âexitâ (cf.
Hirschman -  lower social mobility perhaps increases the number of protests 
            - There is more trust in foreign policy than local policy which is why people protest palestine and ukraine but 
            - he extent to which status positions are stable or variable. People who conceive status positions as variable see protest as a possible method to heighten group status, especially when the low group status is perceived as illegitimate - status as a service??
            - political solidarity is psychological change in the self-categorization of members of high-status groups through which it is no longer the authority but the minority that best embodies the relevant norms, values and beliefs that define who âweâ are and how âweâ should relate to each other.
            - migrants who display a dual identity - Indian families 
        - Grigori
            - Have participated in protests previously, not sure if it is helpful
            - The image on page 11 is incomplete - they cut off the big feedback loop and reduced it into a linear process 
            - once a person decides to participate in a movement - some further development may happen
            - Problem of churn bigger than problem of organization itself. To sustain itself the movement needs leaders. It has to be smart and smarter than opposing forces 
            - whatever the reason the protester had for joining - the movement should be able to address it
        - Venkat
            - Zero protest experience
            - Has not been in any stress where there has been allyship 
            - Never actually occurred to participate in protest
            - The paper covered a lot of the classic dynamics of protests - summary 
            - Protests are primarily effective through social media 
            - In the past - a foreign power instigating protests would need strong prescence but now you dont - you can have a good online prescence and do it 
            - idea of multiple identities - there was a time when loyalty to the company was a meaningul concept - but that is no longer true -  the opposite of it seems truer these days 
            - similar thing seems to happen to international identity 
            - 1920s ottoman empire - significant protests about the break up of the ottoman empire. religion and communism is the only solidarity. Now its completely random, there is no pressure 
        - Ellen
            - Their parents take them to protests
            - one that was memorable - the abortion law was struck down in canada and mom negotiated with the police 
        - Kiran
            - "There are no elites"  - everyone is elite or weak in some way
            - That is also why there are so many protests and counter protests 
    - [What Rough Beast](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5dpnnv2fqdkjz5z84phhcbt)
        - Sachin
            - Kind of a non sequitor but each transition had its legendary comic duo - Don Quixote and Sancho, PG Wodehouse Jeeves and The Office perhaps? 
            - It is usually the hedgehog type/highly aligned ideas that get mainstream attention but not the other ones -  this is perhaps by design
            - network state is the highly aligned idea and something like james scott zomia is the the more distributed idea
            - Role of woman and other crisis not mentioned
            - Transitions are always violent? 
        - Ellen
            - not very impressed - not even wrong category 
            - it will be good if governments handle technological transitions 
            - 1930-1970 - "big governemnt/big labor would have your back" - all the people that I know that lived during that time 
            - The role of woman has changed a lot - in Canada all women could only vote in the 1920s
            - 1982 - Canadian constitution changed and made it so that men and women 
            - "Externalities" - economists - women's work is not considered there 
            - Brian Arthur - Nature of Technology 
        - Grigori
            - Communist Manifesto - the way the times changed has made it hard to write something like the communist manfesto because things have changed so much 
            - these days - you have a picture and there is a lot of incoherence 
            - Sees governance as an optimization problem 
            - To treat governance as an optimization problem - assume it has knowledge(?) 
        - Venkat 
            - Ellen recommended Brian Arthur's book - enjoyed it more than slouching towards utopia 
            - people come up with grand theories of the world - there is economist types and there is sociologist type - both approaches have their own merits
            - the sociologist way is more thorough - for example economists tend to ignore the role of women in the economy
            - economists do this in an efficient way - economists manage and triage with a few narrow tools - growth rate 
            - according to him, around 1500, the growth rate went from less than 2% to above 2% year on year and since change happened at a scale faster than that - then it became too hard 
            - Problem is when the theories are taken too seriously 
            - crackpot physicists are usually crackpot engineers - doing foolish version of this theory 
            - Only sociolgist who went deep crackpot is debt 5000 years -  but the core thing is still economics 
            - This is probably why this attempted theory feelings annoying cause it ignores 
            - Lazy summary of the whole thing - sort of going with the very first thing that occurs to you
            - protocols - it gives you imaginative ways 
            - James Scott - more imaginative theory
            - Good compliment - technology and sociology 
            - Big gap in the sociology territory

        - [How DC got its Metro](https://open.substack.com/pub/constructionphysics/p/how-washington-dc-got-its-metro)
            - sachin
                - things that made the project succesful - the DC ecosystem had lot of inlfuence and power which made constructing it easier - DC ecosystem being the BDF pattern here
                - in the short term - likely to call it not successful but in the long term it is successful
                - big project - the guggenheim is by frank gehry vs the sydney opera house which was won in competition - guggenheim had a BDF or in this case not such a benovalent dictator 
                - building projects are more complex because now communication is also faster - and things like SBF can happen very fast -  which is not conducive for big projects like these 
                - gas prices going up drives the demand 
                - why do these projects still get funded ? if they are not successful? 
                - Austin has a reliable bus system - but all the infrastructrure around it is missing - hard to do that when put under so much pressure 
                - When I was in Houston - most of the people riding ubers were people working low skilled jobs in the center of the city who did not have a car and bus travel time took nearly 2 hours 
            - Matthew 
                - reminded of Robert Moses in the power broker - breaking ground produces a sense of inevitablity
                - subways in places like DC get energy from certain political circles - so that they can move around easily so that the underclass can use the metro 
                - Similar projects - Britain's high speed 
                - slipping dead lines - reminded of 100 day vaccine project 
                - "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice" [because injustice has proven too expensive to maintain]
            - Kiran
                - "burning bridges" as a project management technique 
                - Bangalore metro rail
                - Medellin is a good example of a project that is very popular among people, low vandalism. people are very proud of that metro. 
                - Bangalore -  no sudden infusion of energy, people dont like that because of that reason 
                - highlights how much feature creep/scope creep comes into these projects 
                - paving cowpaths - does that work for such projects
            - Grigori
                - fundamental difference between evolution of problems and solutions that get implemented 
                - large scale projects are trying to solve an evolving problem with a one time fix. The problem does not get solved because new problems come up - may be not the ideal way 
                - lot of acrobatics involved in solving this kind of problem - get approval and then somehow get funding aftewards 
                - projects that are under budget never get stated, the projects are complex and different stakeholders have different timelines. Hard to find agreement about the deadline easier to go ahead and do something 
            - Ananth
                - co-evolution of the problem and the solution is what causes delays. for example DC has a faster growing population than NYC
                - the ridership does not meet the expected demand even though population of DC has grown. 
                - about 80% of transport in the US is in cars, over 50% is less than three miles 
                - Delhi metro - highest was in 2016 and it has remained consistent since. 
            - Venkat
                - lived in DC for several years - probably the best metro system in the US. NYC feels old and rickety and kind of dangerous compared to BART 
                - seems to miss an important point - has not representation in congress -  that played a big role in making this happen successfully. 
                - Core of it was influenced by the big government, nobody local had big influence 
                - Difference between planning and execution - we have a tendency to blame the execution - sense is that reverse is true - the planning is bullshit and most of the intelligence happens on the execution side. 
                - Political savvy in the planning less intelligent than political savvy in the execution 
                - Election cycles does not align with projects that take 20-30 years 
                - people living in an area when such a project starts - you are not going to see any value from it but the next generation will 
                - on the cities track - metro system storeis would be a good class of stories to read 
                - another reccomend - London metro history 
                - China vs US. new systems vs old 
                - new infrastructure get built over where there was old infrastructure 
                - dictator places have straight lines vs democracies it tends to be wriggly 
                - complex system - complexity lies in how you connect things up not in the nodes itself. 
                - democracy is better at stoping things than at building/starting things - yellow jacket movement in France is a good example 
                - has to happen with dictatorial forces but then local resistance helps navigate it the right way 
                - how straight should the line be. 
        - Comparing high speed rail in Indonesia vs Florida 
            - Prompt:
            - "we'll be trying something different this time. Today's ready will be a comparison of the construction and operation of a Chinese built high speed rail in Jakarta and a privately built high speed rail connecting Miami and Orlando. Both projects hit milestones recently, so good time for a comparison. Browse the articles in two local newspapers for both of these, click into the articles that you find interesting. Also feel free to google around, use ChatGPT etc
comparison of jakarta-bandung and orlando-miami:
                - Jakarta - 151 km , time 29 mins, top speed 350kmh
                - Miami  - 378km, time 3:30 hours, top speed 200kmh

                - jakarta is chinese run and operated too. state debt seems like a big concern, belt and road project. japan always has lot of projects in asia 
                - brightline private - lot of accident - built on old rail hence the speed limit 
                - lot of suiing and litigation
                - japan has concerns about mixing technology from two countries -  may be high speed rail does not have any "standards" as of now 
                - definition is 110mph 
                - NSK - big capital city project - so indonesia may be falls among the straigter lines of this project 
                - Indonesia's problems are financial while American problems are more technical and political - politically indonesia seems more authoritarian - president's pet project - do American presidents have that? guess not since it would interfere with the state? 
                - both seem targeted at an expensive market and not a smalll market by any means ? 
                - high speed rail - mostly a middle class/upper middle class fantasy 
            - Kiran
                - timeline for both seem pretty close. Both Miami and Jakarta broke ground on the same time. Miami project - Softbank brought it in 2016. Both had investment issues. Complexity came from the porosity of the contract between china and indonesia. 
                - jakarta provides much more improvement 
                - connecting small ciies can create economic engines 
            - Grigori
                - something similar going on in Russia at a similar time. Already fully electified rail system. 20 years - regular train between Moscow and st Petersburg... regular train takes 8-9 hours. usually from Moscow to St Petersburg which was convenient for a weekend trip. now there is a high speed train and it takes three hours. now you have to spend the three hours fully awake and sleeping is much simpler for 8 hours than sitting for three hours.  so is it really productive? interesting project but times have already passed perhaps 
                - train in miami was already considered in the 60s but projects have been proposed a long time ago - in 60s it was interesting most likely not that interesting anymore 
                - people who wanted to create HSR created initial momentum in the 60s. 
                - underlying patterns - if people are completely happy where they are then high speed rail is not going to help. 
            - Venkat 
                - "florida man behavior" - people dont like disciplined behavior with small constraints in the USA 
                - financing - china set it up as business to business. It was partly underwritten by chinese banks and partly equity in the joint project. Clearly the chinese are concerned about the reputation of driving countries into debt trap. 
                - The current posture is somewhere in the middle of being concerned about it - which may be works because its hard to tell from outside what the actual posture is 
                - "if virgin does not seem reputable then brightline can back out" - was a clause. 
                - Chinese case - state reputation. Florida case - brand reputation 
                - because a lot of it is based on reputation and because those projects are complex people make decisions on brand reputation. 
                - definitely have to misrepresent the project at the beginning to get it off the ground, then reputation manage to get through the project. so its overpromise and underdeliver on purpose - this strategy made sense 30-40 years but not so anymore 
                - HSRs are cathedrals of urbanism - some places like california its cheaper to just run local air that is cheaper 
                - energy wise they are not different in terms of energy consumption. The equation is slowly shifting because train is less and less convenient - especially with self driving cars etc

                - how people orient themselves is different in cities like this - they dont orient by blocks but by smaller stores or landmarks 
                - more like a socio-economic reasons than because it is engineered - the one here seems more 
                - there is a porosity that is kind of engineered with high density  - such as Paris or nyc - but mostly done for policing reasons 
                - the LA cops examples - you need helicopters for that reason 
                - the palestine tunnels are an example of porosity used against governance in some way? 
                - relates to the junkspace idea of rem koolhaas 
                - public transit makes places less porous in some way - sort of blocked away from the rest of what is going on 
                - modernisation is sort of trading porosity for somethign else? 
                - written before tourism became a thing - so what most people experience as porosity is not really porous 
            - Kiran
                - porosity stood out 
                - downtown cancun - street vendors, covered seating, was there for day of the dead, sitting there on a particularly crowded evening, someone new just invited everyone to his house, the public space was an extension of the porosity
                - when you have porosity you feel like escaping the porosity so that you can recharge
                - experience in india where people hang clothes outside -  and it gives apartment buildings these facades of clothes - everything inside is just out
                - when you lose that porous nature, cities can become sterile
                - in many porous areas - no point reporting to the cops
                - land use things in India - they can only be resolved with thugs 
                - legible governance is hard 
                - mass transit system contributes to the porous nature

                - Ellena Ferante's - violet and ... culture - books about Italian

                - enjoyed the reading 
                - not sure how much the author knows about naples 
                - its mostly just massive contrast to what the author is used to 
                - porosity is a feature and if you find it desirable then you will have to pay for it in some other way
            - Venkat 
                - agree with all of Grigori's cautions - they are impressions 
                - the visual description matches perfectly
                - its not quite on the tourist trail, people might stop there but not somewhere that people visit on the way to Pompeii 
                - its not set up for toursim. Its at the intersection of middle east, africa and europe. It was ruled by a scandinavian king for several years. 
                - some parts of it seems true - even if the city seems empty you are sort of walking through people's backyards and stuff like that. It seems to be much more dead 
                - ambivalent of relationship 
                - Naples cant really change - change cant be forced upon it - it has a tribalized vibe to it 
                - on the surface it looks multiculural - but its actually quite insular and each subculture retreats into its own corner 
                - if you are not in the the community, then you wont get access to it

                - more of a missions problem than an incentive problem 
                - better solutions with existing infra - not as charismatic - bus service has improved but no one knows about it

                - played around with chatgpt to assess the fitness of western governments to build big infra projects

                - Transportation museaum - history of 200 years of building the Tube - that is substantial history - it is not trivial to put new infrastructure - predicament to western infrastructure
                - California -  high speed rail is not greener in anyway - it is worse than air travel. HSR really depends on the region

                - The China Construction Eighth Engineering Division, which has more than 50,000 employees and six major branches, is one of the most profitable and experienced companies in the sector. It earned net profits of 12.25 billion yuan (US$1.7 billion) last year, making it the second most profitable subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

                - Speed of construction - it only started in 1997, but has the most expansive rail system in the world at the moment. does that align with the authoritarian places build trains faster? 
                - corruption - probably happens but hard to find out and prosecute just because there are so many people just like there are so many data points
                - lot of promised demand for construction and materials - have seen this in India as well 
                - how much of it is a factor of density and number of people 
                - There is a lack of good propaganda?

                - relationship of physical scale and population density - all the network benefits exist only in large population density 
                - demographic variables determine how good a country is 
                - budgets are still not believable - but could argue from first principles that the costs are less 
                - upside benefit is also murky -market forces cannot price this in

                - In countries, there is a tendency to focus on some new technology for a while instead of investing in something existing - because it is a new charismatic project 
                - its impractical to move them through air, it is impractical now - kind of need the rail network no matter what 
                - you need a really large network to reap all the benefits. Its possible to export it now to other places

                - similar dynamic in the case of TSMC

                - Nile river was very unpredictable. 
                - Economic opportunity was extremely wild because the river was unpredictable. 
                - The emperor set themselves as god - claim to predict what the nile does and so the people obey you more 
                - Uncertainty factors
                - Dune - the sandworms create the spices - only locals know how to control 
                - Paul Atriedes becomes the "predictor" 
                - Both wiki and britannica point out that historians dont like this idea - there might be a germ of truth here
                - Jensen Huang - setting himself up as a messiah of sorts. God of Gods, emperor of emperors because all tech CEOs listen to it 
                - uncertainties - edge of yield, AI software uncertainty 
        - Auroville and other experimental townships
            - Sachin
                - Seems like there is a lot of government support for the project - may be because of its foreign residents or because the Indian government use to appease foreigners a lot  - probably a bit of both 
                - Had a BDFL once the BDFL quit, the project lost momentum 
                - what is the limit of a BDFL town - is it the same as the size of a company or company town? 2000? 
                - Is the Google campus in California a township? 
                - Rawabi Palestine and Kibbutzi Israel may be interesting future reads

                - The structure of governance is noticeable - "it does not belong to anyone" thats the origin. 
                - You have to be a servant of the divine consciousnes -  you make something special - you dedicate it to an abstraction and specificity comes with a baseball bat 
                - population of 8400 people ? 
                - Hard for a small city to do something when there is a downside - it is hard to manage 
                - what we have learned from the auroville - they are not going to achieve the scale 
                -  ???? - same problems in a similar small city - how people can live in the city and make money is not their concern 
                - Economic engines wont happen
            - Venkat 
                - Auroville is interesting because it has last so long 
                - If it gets much older than auroville it become a regular city - if the project succeeds then they lose their experimental status - what is the boundary for such cities? 
                - list of cities - they dont seem to scale beyond a certain point 
                - scaling kills the philosophy - at every scale you have to resolve the problems of the previous scale 
                - The Philosophy of a city would have to be redefined - how does it get redefined? A second generation leader will need to come up with a similar philosophhy -  additional factor beyond not having an economic engine
                - They are in geographies where the city is cheap and they have enough international interest 
                - It's not self sustaining - they are treating it as a living monument - it reminds of the way Canada and USA sustains these towns 
                - There is no big factory - the only factory is tourism and people coming to the town 
                - how many people stay in such cities generation after generation 
                - A city ideally needs more than one economic sector sustaining it

                - Study that shows that air conditioning increases productivity but it seems like air conditioning comes after resources and productivity 
                - The Belgian past is being scrubbed out as the Arab past has been scrubbed out. The Arabs were the Belgiansâ rivals in the eastern Congo; an Arab was once governor of the Stanley Falls station. But who now associates the Congo with a nineteenth-century Arab empire
                - Kind of think this type of article is missing from the modern day because its not quite a dunk on the place and people are not funded to write this type of stuff or find it offensive 
                - documentary about herzog making fitzcaraldo 
                - "The people who come nowâafter the general flightâare like the people who came then. They offer goods, deals, technical skills, the same perishable civilization; they bring nothing else. They are not pioneers; they know they cannot stay" - perishable vs non perishable civilization
                - Horses were brought from Spain in the US

                - Literary struggles to define a place like this is ongoing
                - very resistant to abstract modelling of the place. Rest of the world you can read about the history and get an idea of the place and understand the governance of the place. 
                - no one has managed to theorize africa at the abstract level 
                - all thoughts have to do with sub saharan africa or literary imagery like this - thich descriptors of the region
                - It is at the 1000 feet level 
                - Environmental determinism - cold and heat are very different. India has parts of this kind of environmental determinism. Extreme heat drains people 
                - heat and humidity drains the life out of you - as much as you can do to just lay around 
                - hardship getting people to do ambitious - makes sense in cold places 
                - jared diamond - major civilization zones have had big animals that can provide agriculture animals 
                - If I was forced to live in this kind of region I would may be become a more reactive person 
            - Ellen
                - volunteered with engineers without borders. Know some people who were send to Cameron and places nearby 
                - Colonial influences apparent 
                - Probably not true that agriculture is not possible 
                - Parents visit to Senegal and... 
                - miners without borders - mining being more usable to the area

                - accumulation of knowledge over a long time  - 1000 foot view 
                - sometimes people enforce their view on educated population 
                - what can you possibly do there if you want to change something - live there and they have their own idea about what can be done and what cannot be done

                - Two types of people once it becomes really uncomfortable (1) Bodhisattvas (2) Mentally ill 
                - Very few situations where the method is effective, very few places, and very few people can make this work. These methods don't work. Can succeed in limited ways and fail in too many ways. Not so much a weapon of the weak as a weak weapon.

            - Sachin
                - Seems like he's confused about what a dictatorship is. "everything is a dictatorship" 
                - Rent-seeking is vague as well. A better definition is needed. Sometimes when you *need* to get something done, better to have a trustworthy individual rather than an efficient person. 
                - Rent-seeking in mercantilist is describing arbitrage (not rent-seeking). 
                - Reliance as an example of a company that's clearly rent-seeking but *also* has discovered arbitrage opportunities (but it's also efficient). Could be good and/or bad? 
            - Venkat
                - Cleaner description in Dictator's handbook. 
                - Never satisfied with economists notion of rent-seeking. 
                - Reliance may not be a good example of "rents are good". Dhirubhai Ambani was super skilled at navigating license raj (and produced crappy stuff). 
                - [This might be a better framework otherwise just confused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory)
            - Bryan
                - There's an inner game of dictator's that would be fairly interesting. 
                - Rent-seeking is a reward for dealing with BS. 
                - Cascading rents across Nation, State, Community etc. Yes, those in power are rent-seeking. 
            - Grigori
                - Climbing up a totem pole does not look like rent to me. 
                - Timing is very interesting - 1986 (Chernobyl). Chernobyl's effect on power was interesting in the Soviet Union. Chernobyl + other disasters brought the USSR down. 
                - Small problems can get covered up until something terrible happens (cascading lack of risk mitigation). 
                - Better than rent-seeking is State of Exception. They are the final arbitrator and rules need not apply. Dictator must win every battle (axiomatically). 
                - Very tricky to drop out of the inner circle and retain control. 
            - Jenna
                - Is there more corrupt rent-seeking under democracy rather than dictatorship? Is a very interesting question. 
                - Tyler Cowen had Ada Palmer. Medici were amazing city builders because they were good at passing around rents.

                - Labor and Technology should hopefully win out - Ezra might
                - Non-sovereign individuals are the weak. TOM - shrugs its shoulders and says thatâs life. Klein thinks itâs more a deliberate choice of our systems. 
                - NSIs ultimately have no agency. Differ in their view of who wants agency. 
                - Individuals as the fundamental unit might be shifting -> Team as the individual.

                - Views have not changed at all (but in relative terms and the environment around has changed)
                - The environment has changed a lot. Marc - VC Narrative and Klein - Vox (explainer + recession-born progressive narratives)
                - Whatâs the best interpretation of their stories? Tech-determinism vs. Social-determinism. Generative Pluralism is Venkatâs take on a synthesis between the two. 
                - Progressivism - can we take all the good of technology without all the change in society (communities, language, society etc.). 
                - Technology has a libertarian bias. Weâve gone from very communal a few centuries ago, to individuals.
                - The collectivism is more Star Trek borg transhumanism vs. collective bargaining. 
                - Anybody actually weak, will reject these articles. Both are patronizing in their own ways (Hobbesian vs. Citadel mindsets). Trust but verify, market-based and communitarian model. Use the tools of AI and blockchain, to define what their weaponized new state is. 
            - Ananth
                - Seems more public policy folks have issues with this particular line of thinking. Social-determinism vs. Tech-determinism  
                - Trust seems to be the most important thing in social-determinism but doesnât reference crypto with anything but passing scorn. 
            - Grigori
                - Disagree with âstruggling to buildâ. We are struggling to process information. 
                - The weak are the minority - those intelligent people who think they know the world better than the rest of us. Missing opportunities. 
                - More like a Creed (a collection of âWe believes â¦ â) than a Manifesto - more a structured document with chapters/core tenets.

                - Hobbesian vs. Citadel being the exclusion.

                - Lots to like - no clear enemy - how the ideologies self-perpetuate through rituals. 
                - Use of rituals in the article was mostly negative - perpetuating a rote-automatism. 
                - When the ideology is sharp, writers, artists etc. transgress by simply doing what they are meant to do. 
                - Western democracies may also have a sense of automatism. 
            - Grigori
                - Read the PDF directly - important to tease out the meaning of a dictatorship, lots of nuanced terms.

                - Institutionalized totalization vs. One-off dictators. 
                - Most societies - Havel describes the eastern European pattern - natural state is entrenched autocracy with strongman at top -  liberal democracy can work but it's fragile and needs to be protected. 
                - "Half the society is spying on the other half". 
                - Fundamental character of the US is still from this era - similar to the Grocer's communist slogan - the US Flag flying. Flying the flag is similar to the slogan where it displays . 
                - Instead of centuries old bureaucracy being co-opted, in the US "Bureaucracy of the Karens" - lower middle class

                - Patreons promises seems to be empty words/empty promises ("Creators deserve more ..."). 
                - Starving artists don't need to be in control of their business. They'd rather control the art and have the business taken care of so they don't think about it as much. 
                    - Artists care a lot about the medium. Critics care a lot about the art. 
                - Artists want to emphasize their own brand and de-emphasize the platform brand.

                - A lot of marketing here is disingenuous. Things that matter - tradeoff between platform vs. brand.

                - Substack used to be honest - free email distribution on Substack. 10% cut is much higher than self-hosting (<4000 subscribers).

                - Allocation should follow lagging patterns of usage. 
                - Market-driven freedom is good for farmers but there's tons of incentives that distort cash crop markets. Larger, more lucrative markets dominated by the bigger guy. The immediate customers might be small, but the overall beneficiary is bigger.

            - Venkat
                - Disparity between densities/isolation is very high currently. 
                - Communities are not low density in other weapons of the weak. This seems more a function of sparsity of population. 
                - Populations go into decline. 
                - Similarities with Upstate NY (Erie Canal). These things become cute stories.
                - One answer is depopulating these areas. Another (probably better) answer is to repopulate in a sustainable way. 
            - Kiran
                - Zero interest rate - asset overvaluations has caused more consolidation

                    - ZIRP/QE -> Top 20 banks carried higher debt -> went to large corporations. Then it gets muddled. Then it appreciated stocks (stock buybacks, etc.) The details are  muddy. 
                    - Housing is similar.

                - Techstars blow up
                    - The fundamental investment thesis doesn't work out for techstars. Success is a black swan event. 
                - Secondary market strategies cannot have the payoff when there's this extreme asymmetry.

            - Sachin
                - The bullshit detector is a realist, believing that
âreality is, on the whole, stable and orderly.â By contrast, the bullshitter is an antirealist, treating âreality as inherently risky and under construction,â - sometimes reality is risky and under construction such as in the case of a new technology- wonder how much of this is also cultural - pirotkin of 
                - it takes more work to prove bullshit than it does to create it - because you have to acertain epistemology at all levels and people have stopped attempting to do that
                - There is also such a thing as believing in too much reality which is the kind of thing that makes you depressed - I feel like the DFW essays get at this point in some ways 
                - social familiarity lowers epistemic vigilance. favoring epistemic vigillance over social familiarlty is called culture war

                - Its not a problem - its actually normal - the opposite is actually the problem 
                - If we can see how many different frames you can take that shows how much of it is bullshit 
                - In typical communication - we dont really have a purpose to prove each other epistemlogically correct

                - I actually care a lot by whats true vs whats not true and is kind of annoyed by bullshit

                - bullshit can be used by authoritarians - whats true and whats not true does not matter and you dont have to care about that 
                - Canada has Sun Media (Fox news equivalent) - CRTC - Sun Media attempted to pass a law saying you didnt actually have to say something to be true, unless you can prove it is true - they backed down after getting applications

        - https://www.thefp.com/p/we-cant-wait-for-universities-to
        - The Prompts are: 
        - What are, in your view, the key advantages and disadvatages (opportunities and threats) of creating a new university with a completely new governance structure compared to adjusting governance structure of one of the established schools? 
        - Is timing right? 
        - What are the key characteristics of the right moment in history when there is an opening for a new university that can matter and last?
        - Notes:
            - the climate on their campus prevented students from saying things they believe
            - faculty are being treated like thought criminals
            - But it turns out that fear can become endemic in a free society. It can become most acute in the one placeâthe universityâthat is supposed to defend âthe right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable.â
            - Amidst the brick and ivy, these students entertain ever-more-inaccessible theories while often just blocks away their neighbors figure out how to scratch out a living.
            - The priority at most other institutions is simply to avoid financial collapse. They are in a desperate contest to attract a dwindling number of students, who are less and less capable of paying skyrocketing tuition. Over the last three decades, the cost of a degree from a four-year private college has nearly doubled; the cost of a degree from a public university has nearly tripled. The nationâs students owe $1.7 trillion in loans.
            - The warped incentives of higher educationâprestige or survivalâmean that an increasing proportion of tuition dollars are spent on administration rather than instruction. Universities now aim to attract and retain students through client-driven âstudent experiencesââfrom trivial entertainment to emotional support to luxury amenities.
            - Universities are the places where society does its thinking, where the habits and mores of our citizens are shaped.
            - What unites us is a common dismay at the state of modern academia and a recognition that we can no longer wait for the cavalry. And so we must be the cavalry.
            - We believe human beings think and learn better when they gather in dedicated locations, where they are, to some extent, insulated from the quotidian struggle to make ends meet, and where there is no fundamental distinction between those who teach and those who learn, beyond the extent of their knowledge and wisdom.
            - > For many students it is the degree itself rather than the teaching and learning that really matters. A degree has currency in the labour market and while, as we have seen in some cases, its value may be falling, it is nevertheless a passport to a range of professional opportunities denied to those without one. Not all degrees are equal, of course, and the university brand remains potent. If your degree is from one of the top universities, its value is greatly enhanced. https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2013/04/avalanche-is-coming_Mar2013_10432.pdf
        - Grigori: The attempt looks very naive to me. They have identified a number of well-known disfunctions, but the ivy league kind of works. And it is a very large complex system and all the disfunctions are a part of it. 
            - It works for a lot of professors, a lot of students, graduates and alumni, it works for administrators, it works for employers.
            - Trying to build a system that works for all of them and does more from scratch seems a rather difficult task. So there will be tendency to focus on some aspects, but not the others. For example, people can focus on faculty building and ignore employers. Or on student experiences, promoting hard work and grit, but will forget about employment opportuunities that are available to students of the Ivy League.
            - What they seem to have is a network of celebrities, who made their names elsewhere, academic outcasts, who are looking for stability after being rejected from other universities, and billionairs, who will demand more impressive results faster.
    - [[August 25th, 2023]] Engineering Serendipity
        - Today's read in Governance Studies is Engineering Serendipity: When does knowledge sharing lead to knowledge production? https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3256
        - Focus on first 2 sections: 1/Introduction and 2/Theory and hypotheses than skip to 5/Discussion.
        - The prompts are: 
        - How can access to the same LLMs affect knowledge similarity between people?
        - Can you propose some potential ways of increasing intellectual similarities (personal interests and passions or how people think as opposed to what they know/the body of knowledge) between people from different fields?
        - Grigori: 
            - The AIs know a lot but don't really care about anything. Humans, on the other hand, have limited knowledge, but can deepen it by applying some kind of curiosity. They can discover something or find a non-obvious connection. It seems like both initial knowledge (or data) and the way to deal with curiosity (applied curiosity) play a role.
                - Yet our ability to handle data is not that impressive, except in cases when we generate data by taking actions. So the task of handling data can be potentially outsourced.
                - the generative ability seems to be more important in case of humans. Ability to learn something beats our ability to hold knowledge in our heads. The article seems to reflect this fact. People don't seem to produce new knowledge when they compare their data and conclude that the data is similar. but they seem to produce knew knoeleldge when the compare the algorithms of handling data find some similarities and some differences and then learn from each other by exploring the differences.
                - Some kind of exchamge. i can learn from you and you can learn from me and it will not treaten our relative competitive positions.
                - Generating new knowledge is not necessarily competitive, it is like growing the pie. Best collaborations lead to abundant value add, not value destruction.
                - How to increase intellectual similarities? probably dedicate some time of studying the methods of different fields in cross- domain settings. Can be a conference about methods or a course. Explain your method to a really smart person from another field can be as interesting as explain your work to a 5 yo.
                - OpenAI is trying to explain AI to investors, and this is why these memos are very intersting.
                - We can also try to make LLM a serendipity machine.
        - Bryan: 
            - The more important piece is not tangible. Get along and feel comfortable and safe. I don't think serendipity can be enginnered.
            - Looking for efficiency seems also weird. Peak discoveries seem to be not efficient.
            - Overlap in knowledge and overlap in interest. Synthesize what you know and explain like you are 5 kind of thing. YC is a serendipity engine. we are all hanging out here to create a space for exploration.
            - The difference between resarch and industry: you don't hear about these things in industry because of job hopping. How do corporation look for long term gains is an interesting question.
            - Reversion to the mean: everybody develops the same opinion and drive out dissent. Maybe LLMs can be programmed to fight against that.
        - Ananth: 
            - Didn't quite finish it. Feels like lost cause from the beginning. The measurement that they were using are the citations of the pairs. People with the same of the field knowledge (similar background) tend to not to collaborate. Felt somehow insufficient.
            - Reproducibility crisis. Quality of the works matters. Assumptions can be a challenge.
            - People spending time together for longer time than just meeting on a conference.
            - The entire point is to get the right people in the room and set the context. Seems rather forced.
            - Interesting example: In oppenheimer movie - creating a town in the middle of knowhere.
            - The prompt is interesting.
        - Venkat:
            - Collected links about serendipity. As well as Zemblanity. How do you kill collaboration is also an interesting question.
            - The methodology and definitions are naive. My experience in research: serendipity happens via paper and books you see on other papers desks.
            - Once found a papeer that was fundamental to Venkats research. On a peer's desk.
            - In more informal comntext: watching same movies, listening to the same speeches. Companies have slack channels about industry. This serendipity doesn't show up in metrics. too minor interaction to put in acknowledgements but superimportant. 
            - Weak links in knowledge production.
            - Have to be close enough that you can talk about it, but not too close to increase competitive pressure. The closer someone to you the less likely he knows or can learn something surprising.
            - When that happens you know about it and don't call it serendipity. Co-authorship is weird. It happens either serendipitously or very planned ways. You can select a topic because of who is there.
            - There is large context and there is planned way to reasearch but there are a lot to be done. Instituational planning. 60-70% 
            - Social graph serendipity
            - True Kind of Serendipity: Reveals common interests and something clicks that 10% tips of the iceberg.
            - Not wrong but limited perspective.
            - LLMs are anti-serendipity, they dilute the knowledge. We have limited context. Take the context and dissolve it in water. The probability of serendipity goes down, not up.
            - Make LLM active researcher. Inside a watercooler itself. Make it trained on local context and global context. And it can joibn the conversation in an intelligent way. It is doable with existing technology.
            - Individual usage leads to divergence of all the conversations. If you want convergence -- create a persona.
            - The prompt is a conversation. LLMs overheards the conversation.
        - Sachin:
            - The topic is interesting. The paper is not. Better approached indirectly. Found 2 last jobs via Twitter. Wasn't using Twitter for jobs, and if used wouldn't led to results. Works best approaching indirectly. There is a very boring situation, neither Serendipity, not Zemblanity, but a middle point.
            - People learned a technique of getting to Yale via ticktok, but it spread so widely that Yale changed criteria.
            - Serendipitous interactions on Twitter in 2020. Probably based on oral history.
            - Twitter doesn't have that much serendipity for Sachin and a lot of people feel that way. Going to places like Oakland and talk to random people. Used to do it more online, and now does it off-line.
        - Kiran: 
            - Ideas in the paper are interesting. Inverted U looks right. You kill serendipity with direct approach. The phrase itself is oximiron. How do you create random interactions with people. The answer is blah. One-two day events. Or Oppenheiner. 
            - All you can do is to bring people and let people connect.
            - Field similarity and Intellectual similarity are not as important as vibe similarity. The Gladwell's idea of mavens. In certain context they help to transfer knowledge.
            - People love to tell you what they have learned. 
            - LLMs can cause divergence, because they are so dependent on the prompt. Tell me what I want to hear. AI leads to echo chamber.
    - [[August 18th, 2023]] Stick With What You Can Learn
        - Today's read in Governance Studies is more than 3 years old piece from HBR.
        - https://hbr.org/2020/01/competing-in-the-age-of-ai
        - The prompts are: 
            - How does the growing sophistication of Generative AI affect the arguments of the article? 
            - Can the arguments stay valid when every user has a pretty sophisticated AI tool at their fingertips?
        - Strategies are shifting away from traditional differentiation based on cost, quality, and brand equity and specialized, vertical expertise and toward advantages like business network position, the accumulation of unique data, and the deployment of sophisticated analytics.
        - Grigori: 
            - It doesn't really matter how do you define induustry boundaries, they are more of a blessing than a curse. They help you navigate the scene and make sense out of market dynamics. Now the way traditional industry boundaries are defined is based on the assumption the they don't change that much over time. 
            - But now we have clearly entered the period when the boundaries are moving. One way to describe the transition is from boundaries defined by a supply to boundaries defined by the behavior patterns of your customers.  People still have their bodies located somewhere, so that geography matters. There are other patterns too. Like younger people are faster adopters of new ways to buy stuff via smartphones, older people are not.
            - Ignoring industries executives understand in favor of ML, Big Data is remarkably bad advice. Because, of course, of winner-takes-all dynamics. If you are not good at making coffee, you are not going to get good at machine learning either.
            - Coffehouse pattern. Every couple of years a new brand of coffee shops gets its chance. It basically has to offer a better tasting coffee, which is achieved by using better water and better beens, and caring about the coffee. Inevitably it gets some traction, because of obvious reasons. But an average consumer doesn't have taste for coffee, so there is a lot of signalling going on. Once the certain scale is achieved, the aggregated datat the coffeehouse has points out that they can easily drop the quality and the average consumer won't even mention the difference. So they do. Coffee turns bad, but people keep going because of a habit. Until a new challenger arives with an idea of a good coffee.
            - The ultimate advantage is undertsanding the customers side behavior patterns. It can be achieved via observation, or data collection or data analysis, but you have to know where to look and what to do, which can be not that obvious for an data-engineer without background in coffee. 
            - Another ultimate advantage is of course how fast can you learn from either your data, or 3d party data.
            - And finally, the only thing that doesn't scale is customer's data. You still need to persuade people to join your service and earn enough trust from their side to allow you to collect more data from them than the competition. To earn that trust you need people (either on the engineering side, or customer facing side). Somewhere, there should be people, and a lot of them. So you have to decide what kind of people will give you a better chance to compete with Google, etc. Maybe it is software engineers. Maybe not.
        - Kiran: 
            - Disagreed with the fact that they moved humans out from the center. Amazon WBR. Look at all the data. the data is being ingested, but we don't have a good way of using them without humans. Didn't have intelligence engine. Data come In and the humans are at the center.
            - The article from 2006 is similar from Software is eating the worlds. The business operations is not becoming AI. Have not come to the point that business decisions are made by algorythms.
        - Sachin: 
            - A lot of things are more about algorithms and algorithmic practice. What they are talking about is something like SEO. Google create something because it is easy for users. And then people are trying to gane it and drive it useless.
            - Eventually once poeple understand how to gane the model, wwill the model change. Even within 2 years the equilibrium moved to the side of not useful. Even Amazon search doesn't work. Even traditional retailers hybrid models are better.
            - It happens with a lot of technologies. Once everybody adopts it the equilibrium moves to the other side.
        - Venkat: 
            - The article is from the interesting time. More conventional extrapolation. It seems cynical. The authors may be pandering to the exectuvies.
            - The core argument is 2 models: declining plateau is the other is exponential. I didn't see any justification that traditional industrial scaling has been broken. It is just taller s-curve that sunstitute the older one.
            - the scaling limit of transmission. If you zoom in a wrong way you can come up with the bullshit. The part of the article that is new is wrong, and what is right is 2006 article.
            - Take a single human defined task and replace it with algorythm. Weaak AI is enough is a strange argument. You are choosing not to use more powerful model because you don't know what to do with it.
            - Statistical Quality control to modern analytics. C2A4 is a parter of Amazon. Offers to get payed right now with a small discount.
            - the basic article is that automation is becoming the core. It is not the radical claim. Straiggtforward continuation. No one knows how to integrate LLM.
            - It meant to reassure CEOs who don't want to change. lullaby for babys.
        - Ananth:
            -  Interesting read. The continuation of digital transformation. Felt somethng was missing. It is about competition, but not really. ore like how to apply technology.  AI is at the center, and the examples are google, amazon, alibaba. It ignores that there are customers. They almost dismissed the importance of specialized domain knowledge. Seems to me that specialized
    - [[August 11th, 2023]]  Finite AI, Infinite AI
        - Today's read Governance Studies is this document
        - https://openai.com/our-structure
        - The prompts: 
            - What, if anything, does it remind you of?
            - Can it do it's job long-term? Can it be a source of competitive advantage short-term?
            - What, in your view, are the key weaknesses of the governance model described in the doc?
        - Ananth: 
            - Reminded me of the original announcement. Thought is was impossible. Non-profit kind of failed.  Like shibolleth. Capping the profits, trying to project altruistic take was a distraction. 
            - Give me GPT 5/0. The board is adjudicator of whether AGI is achieved.
        - Bryan:
            -  Similar to journalism. Or the distinction between WordPress.org and WordPress.com. The profits from one funds the other. It feels like they are taking the idea to the next level. But it makes it hard to regulate. It kind of freaks me to make it compex enough to regulate. A competitive advantage -- hard to regulate.
            - Controls they put in place is interesting. I didn't look up the number of investors, but there 400 employees. Not a lot of potential investors to deal with.
        - Jenna:
            -  Wanted a 1B commitments. Relationships with Microsoft are vague. How to exclude. 
        - Kiran:
            - What if they actually meant it? They believe they can invent AGI and want to keep it under check. They mean well, but can do the wrong things for the right reasons. But a part of me doesn't believe that it is realistic. Interesting definition of AGI. Can do enou8ghto disrupt human life. 
            - The people in the middle believe that in case AGI they need not only legal backing but also psychological backing. It reminds sovereign wealth fund. Uncommon: non-profit controlling for-profit. Same with sovereign wealth fund. Government controls for profit motifs.
            - One thing I learned over the years. Focus on product first. OpenAOI turned in on its head. We know them because of ChatGPT. We see the feature that are coming. It is inside our reality bubble.
            - Nice to believe that OpenAI is more important than ChatGPT. But maybe the opposite is true.
        - Sachin: 
            - They honest why they wanted to go from non-profit to for profit. Need to compete with Google, Meta.
            - The map is not the territory.
            - The structure reminiscent of non-profit Venture Fund. Micro-Finance companies. Not exactly the match, but follws the similar structure.
            - Profits are capped at 100X of investments. Not realistic. MS investment is 10B. The deal is to get back 100B.
            - Benevolent dictators and wikipedia. Still depends on charisma of the founder in case of wikipedia. 
            - The core capability is ability to raise money and attract employees.
            - Facebook can open-source because it has all the money.
        - Venkat:
            - The points that have not been made. Despite commitment to OpenAI the models are not open. Don't publish the secret source. The only way to access throughAPI.
            - Safety is justified to be close.
            - Ironic that FB released LLAMA. Some ability to use commersially. Mirrors the structure of Meta. Turned from publicly traded co to privately controlled. 
            - Everybody's paying attention to ChatGPT product and it is what matters. Claude. LLMs with context windows are turning into the community.
            - There is a secret source on how to build centers a lot of cos already have secret sauces/
            - The difference between revealed prefernce and stated preference. Revealed preference tells a different story.
            - AGI is bullshit. The group that sets itself to call it. is like Vatikan. Changing dioxctrie in 2005, but the rest of the world movedon from the debate long time ago. Vatican 11 council is not irrelevant because it owns a lot of real estate and has a lot of power.
            - The currect catholic movements sound like angels on a pinhead bullshit. But it matters. trillions of dollars can be governed differently.
            - You can write a very funny story: make an analogy very apparent. And it can be done to be very funny. Maintain control no matter what. Have an excuse to milking profits indefinitely. 
            - The current pope vs previous one. The new one is social guy. he wants to be good. 
    - [[August 4th, 2023]] The Avalanche That Never Came
        - Today's Read in Governance Studies is an excerpt from 10 years old piece on disruption in education.
        - https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2013/04/avalanche-is-coming_Mar2013_10432.pdf
        - Focus on Chapter 3: Unbundling, or the New Competition.
        - The Prompts are: 
            - Why, in your opinion, the avalanche hasn't really come yet?
            - How can recent developments in AI affect the process of unbundling and rebundling as well as the individual components of educational experience, described in chapter 3?
        - Grigori: 
            - The educational system is build on a cadence that is quite hard to interrupt. You need to admit people each year. You have to run them through the battery of courses and activities. You have to invite employers on campus. You have to graduate the students and pray that they will find meaningful and relevant enployment.
            - There is no specific point in time when you can start inplementing large scale change. And the change raises more questions thatn provides answers. like what happens with our alimnis = degrees holders?
            - Can we secure employers support for at least a decade. Etc., etc, 
            - So that the only way to implement changes is on the same or faster cadence. Accumulation of positive changes as opposed to a big bang.
            - New programs are somewhat easier to make successful than redesign of the old ones, but even in this case the university is happy to provide a bureaucratic noose/rope for a reformer to hang yourself. 
            - And for the newcomers it is rather hard to figure out supply and demand. When there is shortage of AI programmers, everybody wants to scale up, but there is no way scale down fast. 
            - Generative AI puts a pressure on universities because there are signs that there will be a lot of demand for peopel well versed in applying genrative AI. And probably not enough supply. And no easy way to match the 2.
            - Earlier this year Ilya sutskever on a fireside chat said that the number of people increased 1000s of time in just  a few years. And he means research as opposed to application which is much harder problem.
        - Anath: 
            - A really good pattern. Equate education with other markets. It is a wrong way to look at university. Treating university as supply and demand is kind of wrong. One learning for supply and demand and the other is not. The best universities are getting better with age. Standford on Bitcoin is very good. The good universities are getting much better. 
            - Faculty living in one area is interesting. All the readings fits into the team on how current ed system works.
        - Venkat: 
            - It is not that old. Feels much more dated. Like before the avalance there is calm. but the avalanche have came, but hasn't affected ed. University model survived a lot of dusruptions. 1000 years old.
            - Talking to young people recently. GenZ are more interested to university than millenials. Much less entreprenerial ambitions. Back to vakluing credentials much more. For a while a lot of careers especially in high-tech didb't require degrees.
            - But now the pendulum is swinging back. But you have to afford it. Affordability is an issue. Most people pay much less than sticker price. Most people pay very little. Downside is low, the upside is high. and one of the things is zero-interest rate environment. Opportunity cost wise the choice between 2M venture capital vs to get a degree.
            - Brain dead choice is to take the 
            - Peter Thiel did under 20 were moderately successful. But then scale. Don't go to college, go to programming school. Turms out that most of them were scums.
            - In the us there was a big boom and bust in for profit universities.
            - Took student loans and the education was bullshit. And lawsuits were won. In india the demand is higher than supply.
            - Last point: Despite the ,ain prediction is not coming true, something still happened. YouTube channels. Kids are doing things like heavy duty hacking. Zaloof build semicinductor fab in his garage. And now he got funding Good rare outlier. You either billionair abcker or social 
            - Attempts typically lead to very scammy things. Pendulum swing back to traditional universities.
            - What the report is predicting is coming thrue but slower. 
            - As for the prompt for AI. I don't think AI is still there yet. Whatefver the model you need human support from people. Without it it is not good enough. Much o
            - Gaming divison of Netflix
            - UX and Game developments.
            - UX people are coming from Universities but in Game Development is from hands-on experience.
            - Games are much more complex user experiences. It is more complex than the theory doesn't 
            - Gamedev is a field where the university ed is 
            - AI can become a good teacher wherethere are a lot of text books or a lot of clean datsets. Peopel post questions and answers. 
            - One of the fun things with AI is that it can kill anything that it touches. Like e. g. Stack Overflow. No incentive to post questions and answers.
            - Some instabilities are possible.
    - [[July 28th, 2023]] What CEOs Should Know About LLMs
        - The source: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/what-every-ceo-should-know-about-generative-ai
        - The prompts are:
            - 1. Focus on a closing section called Considerations for Getting Started. Does it really address the issue of speed the technology is moving? What are the potential alternative ways for an org to start using Generative AI and keep up with the technology development?
            - 2. Look critically at the structure of the whole primer. What are the most interesting parts, the least interesting parts, the ways to improve the whole thing?
        - Grigori: 
            - The whole document look remarkably boring to me. The contrast is striking. Especially given the breakneck speed the public narrative is developed and the story of Generative AI is unfolding before our eyes.
            - I have included the piece for 2 reasons: 1. We may consider writing a shorter, but more engaging primer based on our readings.
            - 2. We can learn a little bit from McK on how this thing is done and what should we avoid. 
            - Of course the piece doesn't address the issue of speed in the final section (a section with all the recommendations). And all the recommendations are kind of run of the mill. I can imagine a similar article written about say Big Data, or machine Learning, with exactly the same type of recommendation with appropriate terms replaced and only slight modifications. The problem for establisjed advisors is that they wrote this type of thing a decade and 2 decades ago. So there are some baggage they have to carry.
            - The doc also assumes (as you have to as an author) a level of competence of the target audience in the domain. And the assumption here is CEOs know next to nothing. 
            - This raises an interesting question: how do you bring a person who knows next to nothing about generative AI to a level where an intelligent conversation about practical usage is possible? I think it is a non-trivial task, given time constraints, and this particular primer of course failed to do it. But the question is interesting. 
            - The way to improve it is to include some kind of a story. There are a lot of them unfolding. Like Hinton leaving Google. Or Musk going after hisformer proteges with x.ai. Or Google vs Microsooft thing.
            - How do you address the issue of speed? I guess the best way to do it is very direct: This is how to educate yourself about Generative AI in very limited time. The options are: a canon, a short course, a list of concepts weaved into an interesting story.
            - Stories are unfolding, so it is not that difficult to pick one or two. Examples: Vision Fund blowing up hundreds of millions on AI before learning about LLMs.
            - Or OpenAI long term strategy. Or intellectual history of LLMs -> the history of all the breakthrougths that led to the current state. 
        - Bryan : 
            - Same thing was reading 15 years ago about digital tranformation. Interesting to see 5 yo version of AI. They alluded to it at the very beginning. More than a chatbot thing.
            - Classified thing is interesting. A lot of companies are doing stuff like that for a while. It has been around for a while. What is a difference between GAI and other software.
            - People were using software to make all type of pages and pdfs. Yea, you can write software. But it solves a very specific problem, there is no variations. The benfit of using GPT is that inputs can very. You can process them at will. 
            - How often do you have such diverse inputs to process. 
            - Suggesting to a sales person an opportunities for upselling.
            - How much CEO needs GenerativeAI vs rigid systems that are reliable. Bridging digital transformation staff and AI benefits and people lived through it and overall arch 
        - Kiran: 
            - Same as Brian. Recommendations are centralized. Create a cross-functional team, it is what to do with all technologies. It could be cool to consider a technology that it is not top-down.
            - Gates wrote: Hey we are doing a IE. It wasn't the push, but people to make their work easier. There were cross-functional teams. At NYTimes employees were using internet.
            - Employees are already using it. I had to insert a comma. it was a 2 minute job with chatgpt. Give people of the companies the superpower.
            - The old school methods de-risk things from CEO perspectives, but they are not.
            - The use cases. Companies are already doing the things. The way you implement bottom - up is let the things fall. 
            - Have to take care of the risks. maybe we can tell the story. Focus on risks instead of the use cases.
        - Sachin: 
            - It seems like something with acadenic background. Content is fine. There is nothing particularly wrong with it. Applying AI to work, it kind of discounts any intelligence in organizations. The problem is not creating a cross-functional team. The problem is politics of an org that will prevent it to take risks. It feels like it discounts all the real world problems. The map is not the territory.
            - I don't know how to improve on it. The implementation is very specific.
            - Reading the book The Big Score. 
            - HP and Intel were the Googles of their times. Their success were based on technical innovation. The org structure were a nice to have thing. The model was not build org structure first and innovation later. It started with tech.
            - I feel like The org structure doesn't matter. The technical innovation can drive the thing, not the other way around.
            - It also reminded the book called Obliquity. The best way to approach things is indirectly. In corporate organization. The science of muddling through.
            - The anithesis of that. trying to approach a problem very direct.
        - Bryan : 
            - Interesting ethnographic study. How do people are using it. From the bottom . Superpowers. And it is entirely the hype. Empowered individual are superproductive.
            - There are a lot of compaies are laying off a lot of stuff and the rest will be supervisors. And CEOs have little knowledge.
            - We don't know what are implications. TYes. We are going to use chatGPT. And nobody knows where it going to go. How do you a get experience. You have to do some of the work to work the problem. it will be interesting to see where it can go.
            - What kind of challenges do they deal with.  
    - [[July 21st, 2023]] Immortal Artists Copy, Mortal Artists Distill
        - Grigori: 
            - The metaphor of mortal/immortal computing doesn't work for me on several different levels. 
            - 1. the way Hinton use an idea of mortality looks rather clickbaity
            - My understanding of mortality is different from Hinton's. An exact same copy of something is much more dead than alive. This is not how nature operates. It doesn't produce exact same copies and that makes all the difference.
            - 2. I am immediately thinking about my 20+ years old computer, that collects dust somewhere in the corner. I can potentially even start it up one day. So, it seems to be alive. Yet, it is not. It probably doesn't have a browser that would work with modern internet.
            - 3. Same thing happens in business. Companies die because they reain the same carbon copy of themselves from the past. Companies that survive change their mind so to speak. The longest surviving companies changed their hardware and sofware many times. 
            - The missing piece is an environment that is unknown and is changing. So you have to respond to it, meaning to change. Different species respond differently to changes.
            - the information is in the variance, not the mean. In very unique personal experiences of individual people.
            - If you want to learn you want to vbe able to share those individual experiences in a very efficient way. That's why distilling is important.
            - I had an experience I put this information in a container that i gcan share with others so that the can have their experiences and learn from me.
            - 3. The trade-off between energy cost and mortality seems rather wrong. 
            - But the whole article is very generative, as frequently happens with Hinton's ideas. They make you think, as opposed to just repeat the meme.
        - Mathew: 
            - Quite interesting.
            - Neither of them have a better argument. Agreed with both of them. Hinton's argument is digital brains are parallelizable, they smarter. Digiatl brains won't be smarter than analog brains. 
            - the best way to distill information. 
            - Day-today product work. Involves making consequentual decisions based on low level of data with a lot variation. You can average out the spikes and the nuances. But spikes gives you much richer understanding
            - Mortality of computation is not necessaryly a bad thing.
            - Didn't end up with conclusions.
        - Sachin: 
            - Was thinking of other analogs to Parallelism. One example is fast fashion. You create something and use the template 1000 times. It can be copied and reasonably good t-shorts can be created. The opposite of fast fashion is wqhen all the peices are hand made by the person. Each of them unique and a lot of attention have gone to each piece. Mass-production vs hand made. The knowledge and skill of the designer will be gone after his death. 
            - The back propagation part: the model wants to see which weight must be corrected for more correct play. Hard to compare with human brain. Reminded Sachin of  The Inner Game of Tennis. If you focus on the specific of a shot you will fuck it up. Don't know why it works, but it works. Need to be somewhere in the middle.  We don't really know how analog brains work.
        - Venkat: 
            - This is an interesting sociological read. Hinton is kind of lost his nerve. It reminds me Clark's law. âWhen a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.â
            - Separation software and hardware can go beyond human. 
            - The statement that the Human Brains can't do backprop algorythms seems wrong. Backprop is not that hard. We can run it even on a piece of paper. Not a very tricky mathematical operation, not ethoteric. Why it works is a mystery. Don't think it is unrealizable.
            - Elements of analog computers were around for decades. Not sure, but believe thyat it is Possible to do backprop on an analog computer.
            - In the 90s Roger Penrose wrote 2 books on quantum mechanics and computation and subjective consciousness. Ended up talking about microtubuls small enough for quantum effects to be possible.
            - Similar things of other thinkers. Descart came up with carthesian theater, but when push came to shove ended up talking in opinion gland and weird analogical arguments. But this turns his argument nonsense.
            - The Hinton's argument is not even wrong, and a response is not even wrong because the author of the blog post takes the original argument seriosly.
            - Maybe there is something there, it is aiming at it and missing the mark.
            - The best case I can come up with is Britain vs France seafaring technology.
            - France became briefly a naval power. With top-down approach. But it didn't stick. If you achieve a separation of hardware and software, you are not creating something that is better. You get a speedup, but that is not sustainable. 
        - Bryan: 
            - Interesting how self-driving cars engineers handle such situations. Compared with intelligent algorithm. There are better ways to think about it than hardware and software.
            - They take immortality of digital things for granted. But we know that Bitrot is a thing. Sustainability of electric cars is pretty much questionable. How long will Tesla support the car and when the warranty is up is it going to be servisable. And the most probable answer is that they will have to recycle. The whole immortality thing doesn't seem right for me. A lot of operating systems. Computers can't run a single web app.
            - The digital brain can not exist without a human brain. Communities are more powerfull and more adaptable.
            - We tend to think of intelligence as just processing. But there are a lot of things that we probably do unconsciously, we don't do it consciously.
    - [[July 14th, 2023]] What Should Data Science Education Do with Large Language Models?
        - The source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02792v2.pdf
        - Prompts: 
            - To what degree do you agree with the authors' analysis?
            - Can the same logic be applied to other less sexy disciplines than Data Science?
            - What, if anything, do authors miss?
        - LLMs reshape the role of data scientists. Authors argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition from a software engineer to a product manager, where strategic planning, coordinating resources, and overseeing the overall product life cycle supersede the task of writing code. These developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education. Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among students, such as LLM informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided programming, and interdisciplinary knowledge.
        - Venkat:
            - Hoped to see the case studies, but instead found AI-generated curriculum. Similar to what I would attenpt. 
            - Basic reaction. The futire painted here is extremely boring. Turning scientists into product managers is slow death. Solving the problems that you didn't think you could solve is what attract people to science in the first place.
            - Very demotivating. A very different person would study Data Science with LLMs.
            - Am giving a playbook a benefit of a doubt. But then the output is that far less creative people graduated. 
            - The upside if it works it becomes very scalable. Now Data Science is esoteric skill. A lot of people are code or formula monkeys = they don't understand what they are doing.
            - And, yes we will have more manager types.
        - Matthew: 
            - Overlaps with precious discussion. The benefits will accrue to beginners. The more interesting news. On the currillum design front. Quite an interesting idea to iterate the curriculum.
            - Just mapping out the problem space and a solution space and triaging.
            - Not sure how much LLM change the education. the format of an article makes it suboptimal. There is missed opportunity for a rant or a blog recounting experience of someone who tried to build this. Could add a little bit of vibrancy. 
        - Kiran: 
            - I agree, I wish it was a different format. They could give people ideas on how to make experiments.
            - I have two scenarios: a distopian and an utopian. Think about negative stuff more. In my experience dealing with data on my own, trying to present conclusions to people, the key part is to have a lot of confidence. If you do you can wrap the data and tell almost any story. Slice the data differently, and it will tell a different story. If you give anyone a superpower to clean the data and then create visuals you end up generating sexy output, but there is no guarantee that it will make sense to you. When you are presenting to people you need to bring them with you. Where the data is coming from, how it gets measured.
            - Introduces the incompetency in people processes. You need to go deep often times to get an intuitive understanding of the data. 
            - Useful to accelerate learning. But will it give you enough hooks to understand why it is doing the things it is doing is a big question.
        - Bryan: 
            - The interesting thing is to perform the A/B test on the effectivenes of LLM enhanced education. 
            - Does LLM enhanced ed make a difference? People with expertise can keep an eye on model and still train the students. What happens when they are replaced with machines?
            - Who is going to push boubdaries to discover new things?
            - Product managers are the most demoralizing, PMs are business savy, not technical enough to call bullshit and deliver the product.
            - In general all this reminds of lazy web. I am bored and I am not want to do boring work.
            - Having a human design a curriculum and trying to get somewhere vs just checking the boxes. 
        - Grigori: 
            - The main thing the authors miss is the difference between an industry and a discipline. Data Science is a discipline or a major. It is not an industry. 
            - Discipline is something you can major in. Industry is where economic activity happens and value is created. 
            - They are orthogonal in a sense. You can't map a discipline structure to an industry structure, because every industry is cross-disciplinary. And as a graduate you want to have employment opportunities not just in one industry, but across quite a few of them.
            - English is a major. Publishing is an industry. Computer Science is a major. Software is an industry. Finance is a major. Private Equity is an industry. Business Administration is a major. Consulting is an industry.
            - Data Science is not an industry. It is a rather freshly cooked discipline. There are Departments of Data Science in some universities, I have checked, but they were formed rather recently. The whole discipline is probably a couple of decades old. 
            - The appeal of the Data Science as a discipline is that it is by definition a very wide cross-industry major. You can find a job in many different places potentially. So you are not tied up to a particular industry dynamics.
            - An industry needs much more than a bunch of graduates with the same major. So the industry can be very flexible in what kind of specialists they hire and how much training they provide. And an employer can use instruments of life-long learning to teach people some complementary skills.
            - Other than that the analysis seem to be rather solid. It starts with employment, i. e. the roles, which is good. The roles change though.
            - It talks about both what and how? or, in other words, the content of data science education (what to teach/learn) and the methods of data science education (how to teach/learn). But it places both questions in a domain of education. 
            - We can inmagine a future in which What? is a question employers ask. And How is the question the educational institution can answer. and LLMs help them both.
            - Finally, instead of focusing of what will change (almost everything) an interesting exercise would be to focus on what will remain unchanged/the same and then we can build on top of that structure.
            - Like whatever they describe as topics in Current State section is not going anywhere anytime soon: statistics, probability, linear algebra, programming (usually with languages Python or R), machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and databases.
            - One can think about unbundling Data Science (or any other discipline): make sure you have some skills in selected topics and then decide how to rebundle it  and whether to call the aggregate Data Science or whatever you want it to call. 
            - This way you can make some educated guesses and they will inform your choices much better than a bet on a paradigm shift within a specific industry or a discipline.
        - Kiran:
            - Reminded of Seeing Like a State. If LLMs become very pervasive in Data Science, it will affects the governance. LLMs intoduce another level of complexity and governace can become even more confusing. Seeing like a state argues that you need to be like archeologists. Pave the roads people are already taking.
    - [[July 7th, 2023]] DARPA Incentives and Structure
        - The source: https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#incentives_and_structure
        - The Prompt: 
            - When do you think a fair bit of opacity is good for an org and when it is not?
            - Can we distinguish good opacity from bad one?
            - How can an org increase its tolerance to good opacity (without increasing tolerance to bad opacity as well)?
        - > Abstractly, opacity seems important because if your source of money is constantly looking over your shoulder and judging what youâre doing, youâre going to take actions that look good. A source of money like Congress that has many opinions exacerbates the incentive to âplay it safeâ because making sure any action you take is acceptable to a committee is almost as bad as the committee determining those actions.
        - > Decisions made by committees lead to median results.
        - > If you buy the argument that itâs important to pay attention to DARPAâs informal process and ignore formal process it leads to the conclusion that opacity is important to DARPAâs outlier success and DARPAs director is important.
        - > Opacity can also be abused: getting nothing done, dumping money into stupid projects or unnecessary expenses, giving contracts to performers with whom you have a special relationship, or just straight up stealing. Opacity can be abused in too many ways to list and prevent, which means that a better strategy is to incentivize people not to abuse it.
        - Sachin: 
            - There is always some opacity in hierarchical structures. And it is good. For an org to function, implicit opacity is needed. Not everybody can have a full context and everything that what is going on. 
            - Implicit opacity implies trust. from the example of politization of DARPA and government being involved.
            - Needed when authority figure wants playing a leader. When there is no opacity at all, you get people who meddle even with small feature which signals disfunctional org, because no one can have a full context on why a specific button works in a specific way.
            - Bad opacity. Everyone wants to manage others and nothing is done. Section of not hiring people with online presence feels wrong. Works with moonshots. true outliers stuff with high chance of failure or polarizing public opinion.
            - The opposite of start-ups fundraising. Don't want to end up with a lot of cash and nothing to do with it.
        - Shreeda: 
            - Found it educational. Supermediocre with commetees of people. Can see the merits of director being able to defend the long-term vision.
            - Keep it small and limited in size.
            - The bad opacity is preventing feedback loops. Don't know the answer to how to increase tolerance.
        - Venkat: 
            - In 2006 was a part of DARPA grand proposal. DARPA puts out themes that are specific but also too big for a one group. Need to put together at least 3 groups and 3 academics. DARPA coordinated the program.
            - Huge complicated "system of systems" call, that looked and sounded like bullshit. People have taken opacity seriosly and were writing proposals in BS like terms. 
            - What was actually happening: Pick a size that is too hard for one team to capture. The 3 academics will never agree on anything enough to be able to capture. 
            - Big, unruly, messy, headless zombie projects. Academics hate DARPA money they call they blood money and prefer NSF money.
            - All the successful DARPA projects like the internet, or autonomous driver are outliers. Autonomous driver was specific, but not specific in detailed way. 
            - But they dont't fit the mold. Apart from a few outliers DARPA projects are lot of wasted money.
            - Success of accidence.
            - The old outliers worked in a different way. More like an old boy clubs. PM was pulling the clubs for DARPA.
            - Porting the network into new contexts. OSS run by Vannevar Bush inherited social networks.
            - Successes are network related or outliers. Or accidental.
            - Very mixed feelings about opacity. 99% of times it is bad. You need a leader in the middle. Bureaucracy is so good of capturing. Makes a revolving door for an oportunistic grifter. The trouble with Intel right now.
            - Opacity as a strategic defensive pattern is dangerous. See the cost of DARPA. All reasearch should be inefficient, but DARPA is blowing up a lot.
            - Unwise to manage research money that way.
            - VCs are far more efficient than DARPA: 1 invetsment that returns the whole fund, a few 10x, and the rest are losers.
            - DARPA relies on a Selfless Visionary Person in the middle. Not an outcome I would bet on. Without that opacity will kill you.
        - Grigori: 
            - The main incentive is to work with amazing people on amazing things. And you want to keep it that way. It doesn't happen naturally. Seems easy, but there are a lot of other factors involved. One way to do it is to eliminate status games completely. (No promotion inside, you go out after your time). Still hard to keep it that way.
            - The answer on the 1st question hinges on the issue of whether people who funds are competent enough to understand what's going on and not to interfere almost no matter what. Basically, competence is an ability to distinguish between business risk related to a particular idea and all other sorts of risks, including risk of doing nothing.
            - What do you want to see from outside is an evidence that the bets are made and what kind of bets they are. And then you want to be transparent with the outcomes of the bets (did it work out? didn't it work out? What went wrong?) So that you can do a poost-mortem of sorts and learn just a little bit from the outcome.
            - But as an outsider you want to avoid making the bet or influence people making the bet. So that you hire for this ability and then let PM to make their bets, and then let the bets play out naturally.
            - This is good opacity. 
            - Bad opacity is when no actual bets are made or bets are made by the people other than PMs, or the outcomes are unclear, or post-mortems can not be performed.

        - The Source: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-future-of-education-in-a-world
        - The Prompt: In your view, does the article overestimate or underestimate the impact of LLMs on education and specifically business education (and executive education, or, alternatively, whatever type of education you are most familiar with) where the author is working?
What are your the most conservative and the most revolutionary scenario for upcoming changes?
        - Kiran: 
            - The key skill that we develop today is to how to use the internet: detecting bullshit. AI is wrong in a subtle ways. ChatGPT will change your ideas. Will have to use the brush. the key skills -- editing side and bullshit detection side.
            - Good at generating all the scaffolding tp generate your idea.
        - Matthew: 
            - Like a subset of new technology being seen as a slave or an augmenter. Mostly positive. Don't think the author overestimates or underestimates impact. Most of the utility will accrue to the beginners. Will get the rough map of the territory. Also add a lot of value to people who are accomplished 
            - The most concervative; Remains the same.
            - The more revolutionary scenario: from one size fits all or most -> to small groups active learning and 1:1. Will take away 90% of bureaucratic load from teachers, can be good. 
            - A lot of institutions risk to be exposed as pretty poor.
        - Shreeda: 
            - Anti-school in general Pro replacing home work, menial work.
            - Business Education requires a lot of situational awareness from the past.  Don't know how to trasmit critical thinking. 
            - Pro AI working as a lab instructor, helping to solve problems.
        - Venkat:
            -  Good initial framing. AI as a calculator. Liked Inverting the classroom. 
            - Education: three loops. 
            - The First Loop: Formally teaching, formally learning, close it with the test. Has its problems.
            - The Second loop: the best way to learn the subject is to teach it. Teaching context: students teach a teaxher. You don't know where the questions are coming from. all kind of questions from all kind of people. 
            - The Third loop closure: Pass the test, have to use it in the real world. Like the topic of linear programming. Learned, had to teach, finally had to use it in a real project. that was hellish.
            - AI thrown into the process depends on the purpose. Studying for the test, not much difference. Pass the test.
            - AI being a teacher to yourself is less useful there. Sometimes you ask AI for explonation, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.
            - In real world the stakes are so high that you are not going to trust chatgpt.
            - As the stakes deepen you care more for the answer to be right.
            - Think about it like a hierarchy of loops.
            - School is not a revolutionary technology.
            - On the other extreme: people call bullshit on the school. Re-invent the school entirely. Maybe start with the second level: teach.
    - [[June 23rd, 2023]] AI is a Lot of Work
        - The Source: https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots
        - The Prompt: If you have ever seen any signs of ingenuity or creativity coming from ChatGPT or similar models, what, in your view, is the main source of it?
        - Grigori: 
            - To train a machine to be more humanlike you have to follow instructions.
            - It can be that we just misunderstand what is going on when we are learning something. 
            - We automatically assign a high status to a person who is for example lecturing us on a particular sunject because we think that giving a lecture requires preparation and superior understanding of the subject and a certin skill of delivering it in a well-established format. All of it may be true, but this how how we teach other people, not how they learn.
            - The content of any given lecture is not what people learn or take away from the process.
            - What people take away is not the content but some kind of a set of priorities: what is worth of their attention and and what is not.
            - The knowledge is typically available elsewhere, and to acquire it we need to repeat it several times. The best professors just persuade us to give a shit to do the part which is probably quite boring (especially for those who don't give a shit).
        - Kiran: 
            - This is great read. The source of creativity is randomness. Humans are creating guardrails. 
            - Humans are not injecting the creativity. 
            - Maybe it never ends. As long is we have big data, we will have to do the labeling.
        - Shreeda: 
            - Glad the article was picked. Worked for 8 months as AI labelel. Was fired fro. I didn't really realized how work was absurd to her. Was just repressing the information.
            - Have not experienced the creativity from Chat GPT, anything I saw was borrowed from human content. Why I though it was autoomated elsewhere. Interesting Catch 22 thinking.
        - Venkat: 
            - Yes I have sympathy for below API. The author Failed to go to experts and figure out how hard it is to eliminate the tagging. There is no cosmic law of inevitability. There is a plenty of good promising technologies.
            - The big technical part is to include AI instead of a human. Reinforcement Learning applied to cy dogs by
            - Pretty optimistic that human tagging can be eliminated. Important spotlight, disenginious.
        - Bryan: 
            - I really like it.  I don't know whether ingenuity and creativity is the right way to decribe it. Originality maybe. AI does a pretty good job of remixing things. The source is all of the texts that were uploaded to the model.
            - But maybe it will change how we think about human creativity: How do you expect new versions to learn. A lot of interesting governance things. The real world moved on, and there is a completely new thing. 
            - Or when AI dreams up something new and it is not very documented. 
            - Rough consensus of annotating the model. How do you get the consensus on what is a polo shirt.
            - The consensus part is interesting, because we don't need the consensus. If we are trying to outsource the meaning to the model, the model has to be very stern. Languages are very flexible, models can use language to reason .

            - It is, of course, a less than perfect description of how ChatGPT works.

                - Beyond The Basic Training
        - The Prompt: Based on what you have just read and what you already know, give us your shortest possible description of how the mechanism of ChatGPT works? How does it learn? It shouldn't be perfect either. What, if anything, Geoffrey Moore is missing in his description?
            - Why do you think people have hard time articulating the way AI works?
            - Venkat: 
                - Disappointed by Geoffrey Moore. Reduced an excellent book to something trivial and comfortable to understand. You are using language to use language. What makes it different?
                - We might as well say that our brains are similar to electrical circuits. 
                - The question is more diffcult then he is making it up to be. Like an autocomplete.
                - My own understanding: there are more unknowns than knowns here. What is the difference between infrmation and language. Whatever is happening inside the brain is uncollapsed wave function and it is interesting. Nobody understands how it works.
            - Ananth: 
                - Just looks at the number of parameters. How I think and it is not quite different from how ChatGPT works. Recognises patterns 
                - More complex that predictive analysis.
                - Brian: Almost everything I have read about LLM was beyond my comfort zone. It is not an autocomplete. It can not predict how many miles in it to the moon. So it looks it up.
                - Google does it for 10 years. What may be different is trying to synthesize the answer where the google gives the search result.
                - What happens is we all ask the same question? Does it has a canned cashed response? Google has cache.
            - Kiran: 
                - The practice and lore of neural net training. So much trial and error. The fundamental thing which is confusing is why humans mess with the weight. More parameters than neurons in the brain.
                - A good example is a kid learning to speak and it doesn't have sematics. It has only probabilistic understanding of things. Not congruent with how my kid is learning to speak. Semantics appears after a few successful trials. A selection bias. There are so many parrallels of how ChatGPT is supposed to work.
                - The main difference is in the type of inputs. A human being gets input from different senses. And a leap of faith has to be done at some point To go from probabilistic words generation to semantics.
    - [[June 9th, 2023]] Jesuit Education Principles
        - The Source: https://www.seattleu.edu/media/university-core/files/jesuit_model_education.pdf
        - The Prompt: Don't focus too much on the details, try to get a wholistic picture of the system.
Reflect a little on your own educational experience. How is the system that was used in your case different from the jesuit system described in the reading?
Optional: What does one really learn by studying Latin? Or, in other words, What can we achieve by teaching "Latin" to LLM like ChatGPT?
        - Shreeda:
            - I'm mid Uber and going to drop but
            - I met someone yesterday at work who studied in Jesuit syst
            - She described it as very social justice and service oriented
            - And strict about what service oriented work can even look like
            - It seemed that she felt favorably about it
            - I'm curious about the impetus to grigoris question about Latin stuff
                - Grigori: Just came up with a hypothesis that in case of jesuits Latin wasn't so much a stepping stone but a part of "learning how to think" core curriculum
            - I guess I don't see why it's compelling
            - However I thought it was interesting how the paper says the system was somewhat of a reactionary formulation to a decrepit state of education overall
            - Made me think of today's academia
            - Jesuits come up a lot in yak gov studies so I'm curious what the prior insights were or where the prior interest in them came from
                - Grigori: To the best of my knowledge, the first time we touched it, we read this essay, https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/jesuit/ recommended by @vgr#6648. 
                - The education principles were not covered in the essay. 
Even though they played a huge role and still are very influential even after abstracting away the religious part. There is something special about the particular interplay between chaos and order, or evolution and structure, or strength and flexibility: providing the necessary structure and then letting evolution to play its part. 
        - Bryan: 
            - Don't have a religious education. Went to a big public school in Detroit. But similar in how classroom was structured. Heavy critical thinking oriented with the end goal of going to college. The main difference is a lack of spiritual focus. Striving to perfection and things of that matter.
            - Schools in america are heavily influenced by jesuits. There main drive is essentially to get to fancy university. Didn't answer the question what are we doing? Why are we learning? 
            - Interested to hearing from jesuits: how to deal with large classes, like 40 people. Modern school system is industrial kind taylorist system to go to work at factory. 
            - The common thruline is hiring a tutor.
            - Another issue is How to instruct excellent teachers, when you are struggling to give base education?
            - The latin thing is interesting. It is pride thing. You do it because you can. A language gives you an access to the originals, that can be much better than a translation.
        - Ananth: 
            - Grew up in India. Attendeded 5 different private schools. Couple of them were Catholic Schools.
            - Public schools in India are really bad.
            - The experience that we had across the schools were similar in terms of critical thinking, physical education, etc,
            - School and class sizes were massive. No one to one attention was possible. Teachers were doing sermons.
            - Deviations from the framework.
            - Jesuits were not slaves to Ratio Studiorum. They were flexible to implementation. Turns out, that nowadays people are somewhat less flexible and trying to stay true to the established norms.
            - There are a lot of order and hierarchy in most of indian schools.
            - Latin: fascinating on how languages have evolved. Learning a language helped people coordinate. A protoccol for human coordination.
        - Grigori
            - Is a product of a Soviet educational system. 
            - No religion was ever possible. But other than that some of the principles were very similar to what jesuits were doing.
            - In particluar: wholistic approach. The focus on teaching people, not e.g. just math, or literature.
            - Principles of curriculum were also similar: 1) oriented toward formation as opposed to instruction 2) Intensive
            - Similar orientation
                - First, teach how to think (which is frankly is quite hard and a bit of mystery)
                    - Just came up with a hypothesis that in case of jesuits Latin wasn't so much a stepping stone but a part of "learning how to think" core curriculum
                - Second, provide stepping stones for further development
            - Looking back, I was lucky to attend a very good school, and it is still hard to believe that it is very unusual to be proud of your school.
            - The classes were large (30 pupils), but it didn't really matter, because some of the teachers were very good.
            - Teachers were very important, but it is hard to collect the best across all the disciplines. So my school were very strong at physics, math, not so good at literature, but tried to compensate for the weaknesses by focusing on the core.
            - Learning Latin is a good way to learn how any language works. Hard to do when you know only one language you have acquired naturally and it became something like air  (you don't have a proper frame to think about it).

    - [[June 2nd, 2023]] Idea Labs vs Echo Chambers
        - The Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20220723220200/https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/10/idea-labs-echo-chambers.html
        - But because it is a simple compare and contrast exercise, one can spend roughly half the time reading about Idea Labs, then skip to Echo Chambers.
        - The Prompts: 
What are the reasons (or what are the key driving forces) why Idea Labs tend to degrade into Echo Chambers and not vice versa?
What can be done to slow down, stop or even to reverse the slide?
Optional, very short responses needed. What does all this have to do with ... ChatGPT?
            - Does anybody read this at all? Asking just in case.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F-rUh37PdDD.png?alt=media&token=97e67e93-2fe5-4c3e-b570-3934df5d4cf4)
                    - Insert jokes about DC below.
                - Kiran: 
                    - Loves the reading . The idea itself seems a little naive and a lot of societies degraded into echochambers. 
                    - A member of a few idea labs.
                    - Goes back to the theme of archetypes and rules.
                    - Weak norms can be easily transgressed and that leads to charismatic capture.
                    - Degrading typically happens because the norms are weak. In one of the group the core designed the norms and then let the community go. And some people started violating norms and every time the norm is violated it made people feel bad. And when people feel bad they don't think on a high level.
                    - How to slow down the slide? People have to nudge the rules and gradually strengthen the norms. And have enough members who put group imterets above their own.
                - Bryan:
                    - The first initial response is that an echo chamber is a natural state of humanity. We are trying to avoid the conflict. We go with the flow, most things don't matter so much as to rock the boat and risk break the taboos.
                    - Mainstream now is in a process of renegotiating the taboos. 
                    - Informal Idea lab is an internet or twitter, where the ideology poped up, some universities are idea-labs, industry groups, etc.
                    - Idea labs are reformers of echo chambers. They move the Overton window to better suit the members.
                    - Running an idea lab is hard. To hold a taboo position is exhausting. 
                    - A chicken and egg problem. Echo Chamber happens first then idea labs pop up and disappear. 
                    - The second prompt: Darwinian thing.
                - Grigori:
                    - Idea Labs are based on principles, not rules.
                    - The key ingredient is scientific method. It is very young (a few hundreds of years) compasred to the history of humanity.
                    - Most people love to just node their heads while listening or reading. We find it satisfying when we agree with someone, when someone shares our beliefs.
                    - Echo Chambers feel more comfortable. It feels good, more energy efficient to agree with someone, that to disagree with someone.
                    - Disagreement leads to risk of rejection or, say, risk of lost sales.
                    - Idea Lab values independent thought. There should be some thinking in the first place, though.
                    - Echo Chambers Increases group risk, decreases individual risks. (I will not be rejected until the group slides into irrelevance). Fits individuially selfish/groupwise selfless people. Short-term selfish, long term selfless. Idea Labs are opposite of that. (One can be selfless now, when one thinks that there is a good shot for a better future. When there is no shot though, it is better to be selfish)
                    - Having arguments without pissing each other off is also tough.
                    - Requires an effort not to piss another person and especially not to get pissed off. But it is a skill that can be trained. Because typically we are conditioned to behave in a different way.
                    - So It is a skill that is hard to learn. Much easier to pretend that you have learned something by nodding your head.
                    - Echo chambers are cute, but make everybody worse off in the long run, both individually and as a group.
                    - Chat GPT is a giant Echo Chamber.

        - Grigori: 
            - see some problems with this article â selection of the examples and main conclusion
            - doesn't think it's an identity that plays a role here but rather a way OSS is built
            - iPhone example is old 
            - what's special about OSS is that it's not written for general audience / regular people. it's written for enthusiasts and requires some prior knowledge (unix, linux, packages, add ons) but iPhone software is written for general audience
            - apple was known for building software that was out of the box and required no prior knowledge
            - mindset not identity as differentiator
            - it would be interesting to compare a group of OSS developers to a successful iOS developers or something 
        - Kiran: 
            - KTLO & Chores â the main issue. 
            - trivial to commercialize OSS iphone app and publish to app store
            - OSS used by enthusiasts vs iphone store â tax implications, responding to reviews, whole diff personality required after developing an app
            - not trivial to commercialize
            - you can commercialize and put up an app but it might be shitty with no reviews, etc 
            - if you're getting praise from within your community, you might not want to commercialize to a generalist audience 
            - is identity more important than external pressures from community? seems directionally correct to kiran 
            - developer tools are that one spot where you cater to the enthusiast in the beginning â> start with OSS and then commercialize
                - there is a way of commericalizing within OSS 
            - capitalism: owning of means of production by private people (his friend's definition)
                - open source software is a good example of opposite 
            - software eating the world means OSS system should work for many different professions 
        - Shreeda:
            - web3 communities trying to bridge OSS and commercialization by treating the latter thing as an automatic side effect of thing
        - Jenna:
            - metalabel 
            - it's good to imagine about something else besides capitalist structures 
            - nice to revisit that moment in history â> iphone app store, feels like a turning point in history

    - Kropotkin Was No Crackpot
        - Today's reading is __Kropotkin Was No Crackpot__ by Stephen Jay Gould: https://www.marxists.org/subject/science/essays/kropotkin.htm
Some prompts (provided by ChatGPT):
            - Kropotkin suggests that cooperation and mutual aid can be applied to human societies and governance structures.
                - What are the potential benefits and challenges of adopting such an approach?
                - Can you think of any real-world examples where cooperation has been prioritized over competition in governance?
                - Can elements of his theory be integrated into existing governance structures to address societal issues?
        - Bryan
            - General response
                - must accept that nature is amoral, but morality is a key component of human evolution/cooperation
                - The gladitorial mindset is what leads to evolutionary arms races (Darwin economy) - big deer antlers, doping in sports, plastic surgery, etc
                    - predators can go extinct
                - Ironic that it seems Kropotkin was so impactful with his work on anarchism because he was a very moral guy, something most subsequent anarchists seemed to struggle with
                - was reading some other candidates for today's session, was struck that most anarchists are anarchists because they hold the competition view, but don't reap benefits of anarchy, whereas average people who hold cooperative mindset are freer, even under tyranny.
            - Benefits
                - Feelings of safety
                - Resiliency/antifragility
            - Challenges
                - probably have to accept a satisficing mode over an optimizing mode
                - still have to fend off non-cooperative hostiles
                    - cooperatives have to have guardians
                - how to effectively organize cooperative groups in hostile environments with lots of actors

            - Don't really agree with idea that nature has morality, but still there is some morals especially in human
            - open source AI tooling outpacing incumbents
                - google having no moat
                - communities more powerful than companies
            - challenge: dissolving conflict is very hard
                - like an individual trying to achieve enlightment
                    - nirvana that is rare to achieve
                    - if you can achieve, can you incentivize it?
                    - probably not, has to emerge
                    - incentives create a new game
            - examples
                - semicoordinated COVID response
                - markets usually have rules and constraints
            - incorporating
                - can't really force cooperation
                - has to be pressure from environment that is so overwhelming that it overcomes competition

        - Venkat 
            - starting with craft they're very stubborn about it or something 
            - the ethical way of being a craft oriented person: you have to let go of people 
            - aesthetic bullies â craft oriented dictators gone wrong. rant and rave... yell at people for being corrupt 
            - he feels hostility and skepticism because he is usually on the other side 
            - the good thing about the article is that it recognizes that there's a balance needed, not profaning a sacred vision 
            - the alternative to craftsman ethos is protocol ethos â process for coordination versus defining end-state vision with precision. we're willing to shift the vision according to uncertainties. protocol-bureaucratic. feels lifeless and soulless to craft oriented persons. 
            - still falls in craftsman oriented as morally superior one

            - marshall mcluhan frustrates him â would be a twitter influencer posting big threads that sound cute but don't have a whole lot of substance
            - it's a good starting point and makes sense for when it was published (when new media was emerging)
            - last century has been an anomoly â historical anomaly. we figured out how to scale media that were thousands of years old and reach all corners of the earth 
            - but he doesn't think there will be a huge revolution of media â tiktok not very new, just leverages what exists in different ways
            - emberto echo, baudrillard, guettari (however you spell these names) â maybe go towards semiotics instead
        - Grigori 
            - interesting reads & he doesn't get frustrated bc it was written a long time ago and was revolutionary then
            - ages and transitions is most interesting part 
            - people are still using mental models from previous ages on social media and applying it to very different media 
            - we're already transitioning to a new age of media â what AI can produce is hard to distinguish from what humans produce... 
            - what does it mean to be an author? 
        - Jenna
            - always good to revisit mcluhan 
                - my rough notes
media all the way down
signaling all the way down
protocols all the way down
if this then that all the way down
systems thinking all way down
everything is connected all the way down

"a system" is bc someone decided on some borders (arbitrary or otherwise)

Liked the bit about what sense organ/s lead at different times
1. tribal age = ears
2. literacy age = eyes
3. print age = portable book which led to privacy in thought
4. electronic age = started with phone; return to environment w sound and touch, rather than sight

medium is the message
cf convo about the effect of publishing on Medium v Mirror or Paragraph, let alone LinkedIn
            - media all the way down, protocols all the way down = under the hood, systems thinking... which gets to the mystical... keep going down in layers
            - artificial edges around something and call it a system
            - back then, you only knew what the cool kids in your village are doing... 
        - Kiran
            - hadn't heard of McLuhan but had heard of his ideas already
            - his ideas have influenced stratechery 
            - the rise of each new medium corresponds to the downfall of another? 
            - broadcast media has propped up the nation state
            - new media could be the rise of the fifth estate? the common person 
            - each new version has had a lesser impact.... folklore, you've had to memorize things. books that you've had to memorize has far changed his mindset 
            - ownership / authorship with AI... using AI to generate new ideas hardly requires intervention on him. so it won't have a sticky effect or impact 
            - nice analogy with cities... walkable cities. close interactions with people
        - Madebo 
            - hasn't read the piece so going to react to what kiran said... 
            - transition from oral to generative age is an opportunity to r
        - Shreeda 
            - DJ F anecdote... obliteration of artists. competition... good luck with that.
            - originality and markets is something i really think about 
        - Venkat 
            - it was super influential for him ... somewhat sympathetic to bryan's take but you have to understand when he was writing... 
            - it used to take so much courage to say things like mcluhan back then... 
                - in today's world it doesn't take the same amount of courage right now to have these new types of thoughts
            - [lee de forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest) inventor of the triode who observed radio helped create a boost in pop culture / media 
                - these things were obvious but mcluhan had the courage to examine all the assumptions about media x society x culture x politics and flip some axes that were a little to sacred to people 
                - disrespecting the elites a bit.. 
            - people know mcluhan in media and resent him a bit bc his stuff is all in the water but they lack the same courage to make similar statements...

        - Ananth â listen mode
        - Aneesh
            - people have a voice but don't want to say anything 
            - if you want free speech, it has to be done on the government level 
            - he thinks we need platforms but just don't like the ones we have right now
            - if you unbundle a platform, it will get bundled again anyways
        - Bryan
            - on his time horizon, platforms emerged because they solved problems and are built on protocols anyway
            - we're building new protocols but are going to have to build new platforms anyway
            - new cyclical thing on a 50 year time horizon... 
            - tech gods to solve our problems, e.g. chatgpt, (modern age) vs previously thought of divine gods 
            - protocol not that invisible yet not that tangible... doesn't have confidence software can ever evolve to that level 
        - Grigori
            - lens of free speech is incorrect â practically not even dealing with free speech 
            - add short entity pipeline at a traditional company... not a platform 
        - Jenna â listen mode
        - Matthew
            - liked the reading âÂ laid out fundamentals for him 
            - are there any fundamental changes in the rhetoric that have happened in the intervening years?
                - Vgr: sentiment has swung. people would build careers being platform consultants. it's not the villain of the show somehow 
        - Sachin
            - internet equivalent of trad aesthetics â going back to something that used to be good, robin sloan also frames it that way
            - farcaster sufficient decentralization framework -- trying to make protocols work with existing systems (like the big push to make cities walkable â you have to drive there and then walk) 
            - free speech is not solvable through protocols 
            - decentralized network of rapid changes... you can't create great outcomes and adoption 
            - usenet vs reddit description: platforms that exist now are vertical integrations of multiple protocols on different layers. 
                - you have to now horizontally integrate with other industries that solve the same problems for ppl (metaverse, rhea)
                - maybe sufficiently strong protocols don't exist for those
        - Shreeda
            - something is missing right now for adoption... 
        - Venkat 
            - protocol is such a broad concept... handshakes are a greeting protocol, etc. he likes the broad definition 
            - make your definition of platforms as rich as protocol definition but you'll find that there are more protocols than there are platforms 
            - how do you draw interesting platforms around platform, language, grammars, protocol, APIs? they're ways of organizing the instituitonal landscape of social realities  
            - free speech impetus mismatch for this piece... blockchain people talk about it as censorship resistance (which is well defined enough you can design spec it)
            - good orientation piece 
            - everyone wants tokens but no one wants to show up for governance votes... given a voice but not using it 
            - trad thing is a red herring -- new protocols are going to be much more sophisticated. 
            - protocols get captured as platforms as they age â surface reason is spam. a problem you can only solve with massive scale. spam was used as the excuse to capture the email protocol. you get a nice protocol, it gets exploited. someone steps in to stop the exploitation. then it becomes a platform. then platform gets disrupt. then people build new protocols... maybe that's the lifecycle but not super confident it tracks

        - Ananth
            - easy to read & liked it
            - web3/blockchain ecosytem 
                - computers, internet, internet forums / governance mechanisms, layer 1s, primitives / NFT toolings, application layer 
                - how do the layers impact each other?
        - Bryan
            - disappointed it was not a solar system model 
            - don't like the way they categorize the layers -- dynamics of civilization don't match neat layering 
        - Grigori
            - pace and layering --> temporal and spatial dimensions (happens a lot in natural sciences)
            - skyline of a city as an example
            - conflation of space and time should be relegated to natural sciences and should not be discussed by other domains... 
        - Jenna
            - guidance counselors have to help people understand time horizons
            - anything that tries to model everything is wrong but anything that points to time horizons is good 
        - Kiran
            - It made him think of a ribbonfarm post with layers (people, instituitions, markets, ideas)
            - recycling shouldn't place responsibility at the level of individuals --> wrong level of abstraction 
            - the nature of work is the system that interested him
        - Sachin
            - He didn't really like the layer thing â it feels wrong 
                - Depending on the time that you're in, they're moving at different paces; maybe it's more like the other layers adapt to one that is moving the fastest. It's not neat 
                - A new technology that is taking off rapidly -- all technology being an extinction of the senses? A new technology accelerates one sense by numbing the other senses
                - Last 10 years --> a lot of activity in commerce but not changes in infrastucture 
                - Harmot Rosa reading on acceleration (frenetic standstill) â things are moving so fast that there is no change taking place. Lot of speed but nothing really happens or moves forward. 
                - End of History essay â Hegel predicted end of history in 1806
        - Shreeda
            - still new and young
        - Venkat
            - lots of thoughts because he's been thinking about this for a very long time 
            - the part of the model that is wrong is where most of the interesting stuff happens 
            - solar system orbits â unstable orbits that collapse or collide
            - human civilization doesn't operate like this
            - âThere are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happenâ â Vladimir Ilyich Lenin

            - Eruptions and change â tectonic and volcanic activity 
                - Pace layers have to collide 
            - why is this model so attractive? clean stacks that miss the point
                - architectural cleanliness 
                - pure arts â music and architecture, pure in time, pure in space 
                - architect pretending to be a musician... 
                - architectural thinking leads you astray b/c in buildings you have artificial control. platonic, clean
                - things you can design vs complex, emergent systems

        - Bryan
            - "Each component of the trilemma comes laden with costs and benefits, so each major international policy regime has strengths and weaknesses"
            - "Note that those were the prevailing regimes. Because nations determine their monetary relationship with the rest of the world individually, some countries have always remained outside the prevailing system, often for strategic reasons."
            - "__But just as no country can do away with scarcity or asymmetric information, none can escape the trilemma (a dilemma with three components), also known as the impossible trinity__."
            - Sovereignty, Ambition?, Wealth, Intellectual/creative freedoms, open borders
        - Venkat
            - governance knobs
                - Attributes: Absence of a BDFL, high-enough muddling through tempo, exit/entry balance of people, level of voice, "friction" in civic processes, voter turnouts, the dictator's handbook categories (essentials, influentials, interchangeables), KTLO...
            - can you have a dictator, can tempo be high enough, can you have free entry/exit
            - interest rate = muddle through
                - low rates = low friction
            - bdfl
        - Matthew
            - interesting that they used examples to explain why certain mechanisms can't coexist with others
            - markets get exploited, institutions get captured
        - Kiran
            - free capital movement being people entry exit
            - fixed foreign exchange rate being social status or credibility of group
            - ind. monetary policy = being able to set long term goals inside the group
            - if you allow movement of people, is there a lot of churn and tough to get social status working?
        - Jenna
            - fast-cheap-good, pick two
            - like the trilemma, not sure about what the push and pull of corners may be
        - Grigori
            - we are going backwards
            - instead of having list of regimes that we have observed, we are trying to solve a problem that says something about governance
            - doesn't appear that this problem can be solved
        - Ananth
            - optimization problems in engineering
            - milton friedman, against going off gold standard
        - Sachin
            - trilemma of governance seems too broad
                - gets abstracted away too much
                - trilemma of specific things within governance might make sense
                    - BDFL trilemma
            - common knowledge is important, probably a vertice
                - makes coordination and alignment easier
                - more interestingness
            - inventories not identities
                - how individual identities play into governance models
                - IDs specific to contexts, "identity stacks"

2. https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest 
        - Bryan 
            - there is really no escape â how do you live outside of any surveillance mechanisms? there are really no stateless frontiers anymore
            - stateless crypto stuff is interesting in theory but a little immature 
            - his fav part of a lot of crypto tech --> the state has to say yes to neoliberal ideal of freedom 
        - David
            - He lives in Italy and sees this play out â what tribes are becoming stronger in the online conditions? 
            - are we seeing an evolutionary process in AI and that strategies of being human won't be effective for long? 
        - Grigori 
            - the book review struck him as very arrogant: the tone of the article, e.g. consider the claim that the valley people know enough about the hill people â you'd have to approach the hill people who don't want to talk to you at all
            - convergent evolution of ungovernability --> 
            - second article is a metaphor for hill people.... digital barbarians. 
        - Jenna
            - culture of going to the beach as a glamorous thing is a recent invention. previously, pirates lurked there and it was a dangerous place 
        - Matthew
            - there's a bit of comfort in the fact that people are always trying to escape --> our particular contemporary era isn't the only one dealing with these dynamics of voice and exit, etc. 
            - connection between barbarian mode and goblin mode. taxonomy of digital ecosystem
            - 
        - Sachin
            - made him think of a bunch of other readings â deluze and striated vs smooth spaces. states do the thing of making smooth spaces striated 
            - 4chan is not barbaric... maybe it was a smooth space at one point 
            - nobody wants to be a full barbarian
            - migrants have a high degree of non identifying with national identity.... anything with indian identity is a late 20th century construct. any kind of striation is top-down and more modern 
            - top percentile income in their own strange countries make the best developers. underrated barbarian culture. good engineer, have a starlink 
        - Shreeda
            - ideas of legibility 
        - VGR
            - hill people --> fiction and stories and mythologies happen to be very interesting and don't fit into canons of valley people 
            - he doesn't think there will be a lemon market or the particular remedies she suggests are that compelling

            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience 
        - Bryan: 
            - table 1: non-instrumental vs instrumental 
            - his prior understanding of civil disobedience was much more individualistic 
            - what has to happen for something to become instrumental? 
            - there are two meanings of civil: be polite in a disagreement, but also Civic duty that people have 
            - when does civil disobedience become a militant disobedience? 
        - David: 
            - so much study of governance isn't empirical â waiting for dataset to validate the model 
            - actors and protestors might not be fully rational beings (obviously the case); he thinks the paper isn't accounting for human nature of optimism
            - protest tactics that piss people off (rebellion, throwing paint on paintings); reframing the space of what is possible
        - Grigori 
            - crowd disobedience is a dynamic situation 
            - you have to also take into account the rationality of the power group / state / leader
        - Jenna
            - same point as bryan about individual rule breaking 
        - Kiran
            - being indian, you get introduced to it early-on in life
            - put more nonviolent civil disobedience into context
            - for every civil disobedience movement, there's a corresponding violent one
        - Sachin
            - is this an ealry to mid 20s model that is not successful anymore?
            - people are more atomized, so how do you coordinate on a large scale? they're not successful anymore 
            - successful civil disobedience movement needs to be co-opted by an organization that can help them
            - it's more coopted as cyncism as ideology (zizek)
            - bjp party... also a failed disobedience movement
            - are there recent examples? cynciism as ideology civil disobedience 
            - model disobedience: too much symmetry of information..... either be cynical leader (you're sticking it to the system) like elon or trump (admit to being morally fraud person who is cynical) or you're like Mishima (committed sepoku, symbol for japanese new right movement)
        - Venkat
            - civil disobedience is not actually bounded rational, it's actulaly super-rational
                - it adopts a rationality that is larger 
                - information about the leader to be revealed: either weaker than he looks, or deep-state type of archetype (too harsh)
                    - in either case, you force a change... they quit, they're removed by military or democratic voting
                - creates a common knowledge cascade --> foundation for governing narrative changes 
                    - yet it doesn't explain most attempted civil disobediences 
                    - there's a level of modeling and analysis beyond revolutionary change 
                    - the paper is trapped.... point that thoreau makes
                    - âOne would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate, penalty?â
                        - states are incapable of answering questions of their own moral legitimacy --> the state itself could be irrational 
                        - sometimes it's not just revolutions. there's a whole narrative shift. 
                            - you can swap governments thru revolution but it might not change the narrative
                            - the planner wins if they can move the equilibrium of the governing body's philosophical narrative
                    - current spheres: climate, blm (what is the fundamental narrative shift they want?)
                        - shift the moral authority narrative from neoliberalism to degrowth 
                        - blm: what is it beyond civil rights movement stuff from 60s? 
            - threaten the legitimacy of the governing narrative but doesn't spurn aggression 
            - if you react in an extremist way, that leads larger group to question their loyalty to their state
            - trump led a civil disobedience movement by breaking a lot of informal norms and guardrails of american democracy 
                - emergent virtual leader... him + pepe people etc

        - Responses: 
            - Bryan
                - he sees the reading as a narrative of sovereignty as opposed to something that would be more interesting to him
                    - he would like something more instructional â how to wield sovereignty; suggests something more anthropological
                    - people pretty much ignore laws
                - Mafia has been intertwined with the government; organized crime gets license to operate sometimes â organized crime is the de facto law enforcement
                - sovereignty and agency? are they the same?
                - Magna Carta: the common people have the same rights / rule of law; that has granted us all freedom
            - David
                - he got three things from the reading 
                    - he believes political communities come together not through their institutions but primarily b/c they have a common purpose and are necessary to kill outsiders
                    - sovereign idea 
                        - not empirical 
                        - not an evolutionary dynamic
                            - brexit: a failure to understand how european instititions are embedded in british politics

                - punishing the enforcer of the law, reminds him of the texas abortion law where you can sue clinics in violation and get 10K
                - you can see quietly making exceptions in a lot of corporations 
                    - quiet-quitting; making an exception without consulting a higher authority
                - when moved to US, he thought it was weird that suburbs have sidewalks but no one is walking on them; in India, infrastructure was broken but people were still walking anywhere
                    - maybe people are not cynical enough today 
            - Shreeda
                - is it actually dictatorial?
                - governance coming across from a state of exception 
            - Venkat 
                - Schmitt is something that's referenced in a lot of articles
                - dissonance between reality and the model âÂ how does it effect how you should think about it? 
                    - more people comply with the model of politics in a ceremonial sense even if they don't sincerely believe in political rhetoric
                - the power to make exceptions needs some nuance; almost like a risk management exercise
                    - worry about your right to make exceptions and who has the right to enforce punishments 
                        - representatives of the state who enforce punishments
                        - the mob â can police your right to exceptions
                        - self-appointed busy bodies; e.g. karens 
                            - axelrod (norms are strongly founded if people take on the role of enforcing the meta-norm) 
                                - punishing those who decide to not enforce the norms 
                - who gets to make the exception vs who gets to openly make the exception
                    - everyone gets to break rules here and there but very few people do it very openly 
                        - cynicism (https://nosubject.com/Cynicism_as_a_Form_of_Ideology) is more closed 
                        - who gets to openly flout? 
                            - actual monarchs (ceremonial outlaws)
                            - outlaws (spaces where the police don't dare to go, e.g. the mob. beyond the frontiers of what is claimed)
                            - january 6th; open sedition (you feel like you're powerful enough; current state of governance gets discredited)
                    - narrow view of schmitt â only take people who can legally make exceptions seriously; but most systems aren't that tightly controlled. 
                        - the median system has enough people capable of being in violation
                    - people take the model view extremely seriously as a normative prescription
                        - people hope that there is a monarch for repairing the system
                            - opens the door to totalitarian models of governance
                            - moldbug etc people go down this path
                    - We should read something about the theory of civil disobedience. Gandhi, Rosa Parks etc. When people make a calculated judgment that the law can be safely challenged.
                    - surveillance state makes exceptions a lot less viable 
                        - every act of exception will become an act of civil disobedience

    - ###  Fri, Jan 6th, 2023
        - Selected reading: News from now here; most and least important moment of 2022 
        - Prompt: 
        - Responses: 
            - Jenna
                - what is the long now doing with this piece? why are they publishing it? who is this person? 
                - pointing at something interesting but obvious
                - most / least moment
                    - most: january 6th insurgence; a fruiting spore of collapse (even though it was 2021)
                    - 
            - Kiran
                - it was a confusing piece â prefigurative politics was defining it
                - before you have a lot of followers on twitter, you have to act like you have a lot of followers on twitter 
                - future is not 1 to 1
                - most and least moment: 
                    - most: also jan 6th, but also the war
                    - least: saudi beat argentina 
            - Shreeda
                - OODA loops (Such an unstable, open-ended political environment makes it hard to sustain any fixed notion of future accomplishment.)
                - There are many alternatives (Utopia is not held up as âthe end,â but can be invoked in order to assert the possibility of different alternatives and the revolutionary openings these may involve, the advent of a radical alterity here and now. )
                - Interstitial process / muddling through (The only possible way of conceiving revolution is as an interstitial process that involves the creation, expansion and multiplication of cracks)
                - Prefigurative politics and shifting nature of how time works in today's politics / social media / there's a new narrative often 
                - most / least important:
                    - most: 
                    - least:  
            - Venkat 
                - he liked it and thought it made some non-obvious points
                - unambiguous emotional disposition --> the non-obvious point
                    - the affective disposition towards the future; what emotions do you have about times other than the present? 
                        - hope vs despair (future); primarily an emotional mood then you have an intellectual context
                        - what happens when you subvert that idea that the emotional vibe has to be a coherent one? 
                - future is unevenly distributed (more obvious point)
                    - practicing the future doesn't necessarily invoke it; causing the future you desire is not the same as living it
                - most / least important moment: 
                    - ukraine conflict --> a moment of resolution never arrived; the moment that didn't happen (in terms of broad global consciousness arriving)
            - Grigori
                - the article was hard to read
                - there are different dimensions of now
                    - reflecting on the world cup
                        - project the future from right now or the general trend from before 2018/2020 --> two completely different fields/pictures
                        - this can be one of the definitions of a revolution; something happens and there's an inflection point. you're uncertain of whether you should go back to the previous trend or make something happen from where you are right now
                - most / least important moment: 
                    - ukraine conflict

- ## Summer '22 Reading Tracks 
    - Humming Part 2
        - Matt
            - managing exceptions instead of the typical case
            - strength of disagreement is more important that the number of them
                - strong objections are against consensus
        - Jenna
            - underlying assumption that there is a best technical solution
                - if you know the best exists, why do you have to find consensus
            - watership down, rabbits decision making
                - suddenly group makes a decision and they start moving in the same direction
        - Kiran
            - outcome driven nature of IETF helps how they govern
                - most online communities don't have to worry about making the right technical choice
            - bringing along as many people as possible
            - if you aren't outcome driven, how does that change governance?
            - vote stuffing is harder to do face-to-face
        - Venkat
            - thinking about IETF more as judiciary
                - preventing the tyranny of the masses
                - not quite judiciary
                    - judge in court room follows due process principles
                    - if court is unable to reach conclusion within it's paramaters, the judges just make something up
            - what happens if chair makes poor judgement call on technical matter
                - often have forks, where subset of group splits off and tries to make a competiting alternative in the marketplace
                - IETF is a monopoly
                - judicial process where questions are raised to the marketplace to decide
        - Grigori
            - purpose of humming is to raise relevant issues and then address them
                - that's why it happens at the start, to uncover issues
            - doesn't really resolve main risks of thee methodology
                - people come unprepared, don't see/understand the issues
                - chair doesn't follow procedure, what seemed to be consensus in actually invalid
                - chair used power to mislead the group
                - participants have doubts, or have reasons to remain quiet
                - participants playing power games
            - 
        - Bryan
            - I don't know much about IETF, but assuming it doesn't make sense to fork it, so it doesn't have the same sorts of schisms that tend to develop in OSS
            - consensus requires faith in the institution
            - coersion in the face of consensus
        - Matt
            - Could technical power / political power / market power form something like an iron triangle?
    - On Consensus and Humming in the IETF
        - Grigori
            - definition via negation
                - what __cannot__ be said?
                - dealing with people who don't want to vote but vote anyways
            - all about power structure, not decision making structure
                - the chairs have a lot of power, play a lot of power games
        - Kiran
            - "in the quest to avoid" they ended up with all three
            - majority is starting point, not end
                - looking for places to continue conversation
        - Matthew
            - how do you build in correction mechanisms to catch errors early?
            - governance by explicit mechanics vs governance by vibe sampling
            - this fails in an interesting way
            - testing for consensus
                - contemplative practice tools that explicitly designed to understand the assumptions that you have
                    - what's the collective equivalent of that?
            - rough consensus and running code not easy
                - requires both technical and social proficiency
                - cannot be transplanted into different contexts
                    - brand new group couldn't pick this up and run with it
        - Sachin
            - getting rough consensus feels like the job of product manager
            - equivalent of a hum in meetings
                - raise objection -> lets take this offline
            - how was it when people were working IRL together?
                - online interfaces don't provide affordances for hums and subsequent discussions
                - no way to build top-down alignment in an org w/ remote company
            - echo matthew's point re:meditation
        - Venkat
            - IETF has lived through a bunch of historical-technical events
                - important point, they are successful org
                    - maybe moreso than w3c and eth governance
            - comparing and constrasting to large corporations, since IETF is one of a few orgs of it's type
                - most corps have condition of bureacratic capture
                - in practice, corps are governed in ways that looks like this
                - intel has been captured, amazon still run by king
            - IETF is form of legitimate bureaucracy, it's designed to be a bureaucracy
                - they think capture is a good thing, and the threat of democratic capture looms large
                - democratic tendencies do so with ignorance of the rough consensus mechanisms
            - diff from informal democracy
                - hum start of convo vs. end
                - matters of principle vs matters of taste
            - healthy document within healthy tradition
        - Bryan
            - a lot of this comes down to expediency
                - asking for objections instead of opinions means you can move on
            - also seems like the most successful people I've encountered are the ones who have pointed objections but otherwise go with the flow
            - trick is avoiding the "looks good to me" culture or worse "do what you want"
            - second order hums
                - getting people to acknowledge objections raised by others that they hadn't considered
                    - especially present in multidiscipline groups that defer to a particular individual's expertise
            - https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe
    - Great Founder Theory
        - Bryan
            - yeah duh airport management book vibes
            - lots of founders actually don't do a good job and/or build something that's not great that still somehow succeeds
                - also what about when founders sell or otherwise rescind power to someone else who continues building and maintaining the thing
            - author seems to be focused on pattern matching the last century's leaders, but what would he say about the emergence of the BDFL archetype?
            - author seems to think that everything is high stakes, all or nothing
            - leadership in military an sport?
        - Grigori
            - suprised this topic is still discussed
                - in his part of the world, War and Peace helped settle this 150 years ago
                    - great men are just labels, it's easy to have them, they don't really provide power themselves
                    - https://www.marxists.org/archive/tolstoy/1869/war-and-peace/book-9-chapter-1.html
            - if you dive deeper into his examples (gov, biz, uni), they lose track of foundational principles and people
        - Matthew
            - whats the outcome of the founder-victim mindset?
            - weary of framing around great founders
                - body of institution is standing in the way of individuals are capable of getting the institutional goals achieved
                    - that feels naive
                    - in institutions, there's usually good reason that the brakes have been applied
            - can looking at history become an infohazard?
        - Sachin
            - type of thinking that leads to people believing in SBF-type characters
                - gets proven time and again but always comes back
            - great founder theory leads to less technological development?
        - Shreeda
            - parallel between big man stuff and great founders
                - great founder is aspirational version of big man
            - institutions don't follow evolution...they lack memes, etc
                - how buildings learn...maybe there is mechanism for evolution
            - his idea of institution is different from fukayama's
                - FF describes it as extension of military states
        - Bryan
        - Venkat
            - Copying over my page of links on [[Straussian]] philosophy in case we want to read more on that, it's sort of the steelmanned version of this stuff
            - Adding screenshots of my thread
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F9xINguaeKF.png?alt=media&token=75be4101-10fb-4259-bbff-95e868067ba7)

    - What I learned co-founding Vox
        - Bryan
            - What is success?
                - hitting KPIs?
                - Clout and legacy?
                - Mission Accomplished?
            - Appears that they didn't try hard enough and didn't use their imaginations
                - Founding team has all left, why?
            - You can't try to disrupt only part of the incumbent playbook
            - "This was not an important aspect of the analog journalism skillset because editorial staIers had to \ght to obtain precious column inches. In digital, the space is limitless, so itâs generally good to do more."
                - this assumption seems wrong
                - constraints are good
            - how to train people to do performance art vs do a job
            - obligatory "low interest rate" comment
            - no plan, no strategy, just vibes
            - reminds me of nymag in the 70s, hostile takeover by Rupert Murdoch
                - ironically nymag is now owned by vox
        - Venkat
            - interesting on two levels
                - story of media landscape over last 15 years
                    - coincides w/ ribbonfarm arc, the road not taken for him
                    - nothing too surprising, clickbait artists, etc
                - degree to which platforms ended up shaping content strategy
                    - long narrative leads for recipes, etc
                    - writing for algorithms instead of audience
            - convo at Yak C about tech stack and environment we use
                - we feel similar pressures w/r/t to VC backed platforms
                - some time VC/ad-supported biz models have to make more money
                - DAO tool crowd will have to deal with the same thing
            - purely internal strategies don't map onto extrnal environment, you might have to give up on it
            - governance context on strategy
        - Shreeda
            - can't scale a small group's instincts, can't commodify high-quality mission-driven thinking
            - coordination headwinds probably maps onto this too
            - platforms stipulating what content looks like
            - history of 21st century journalism...need a book about this
            - how TED talks have influenced a lot of downstream thinking
            - ending was meh, feels like author is pandering
        - Sachin
            - even if author could've solved their problems, it never seemed like Vox went deep, they just descriped things, would've been disrupted by AI anyways
            - chat GPT reduces the value of thin descriptions
            - thin desc have zero marginal cost, easy to get them via compute
            - platforms changed journo status game from writing for a specific outlet to having a following on twitter, substack readers, etc
            - outlets are the middleman, can be disrupted
                - outlets cashing in with clickbait articles
                - clickbait articles are good fodder for twitter beef
        - Jenna
            - grow or die conundrum
                - if you have to get huge to survive, that's no good
            - things on YT w/ millions of views that you never hear of, remind how massive these platforms are. ideas spread fast
            - inside baseball
                - journos like to dunk on the author
            - don't die, just find ways to survive
        - Grigori
            - issues of governance not discussed, understandable bc author is a writer
                - publications live and die on backs of writers (in mind of the writers)
                - chinese wall between writers and operations (ad sales, biz dev, etc)
                - who is responsible for the business model
                    - writers again think they are, but they aren't capable
            - cannot take biz model for granted in the modern media landscape
                - as soon as you think you have it, you probably don't
            - zero to one
                - rediscovered the difference between twitter and NY times
                - thiel talked about how twitter has huge valuation because of bright future
                - if you look back, twitter goes sideways, NY times has grown
            - misunderstanding of platforms in this article
                - author blames platforms
                    - news orgs were some of the first platforms in the world
                        - because they were the first two-sided marketplace
                        - don't understand why news orgs have forgotten about this, instead blame the platforms
            - story of NY times success is interesting, need to find an account of it
    - Bobos
        - Bryan
        - Grigori
            - you don't have to be right to be famous
            - you only have to be right from time to time
            - if you want to be exemplary bobo, you have to be clear and make a point with viral properties
            - jobs of pundits like David Brooks are gone
                - NYT still exists, some columnists are still well known, but there are only dozens of these people anymore, not a whole class
        - Kiran
            - excerpts seem out of touch 20 years later
            - bobos are a middle class, the stooges of the true elites that don't have to play by the rules

    - [An Exploration of Internet-Native Organizations](https://www.forefront.market/blog/internet-native-organizations)
        - with special guest Scott Moore
        - Scott
            - doing work in web3 since 2015-16, around the idea of decentralized companies
            - built project inspired by work in machine learning, feeding contributor results from orgs and distributing equity between organizations to create founder collectives
            - DAO hack happened, nobody talked about daos for a while
            - merged his project with Kevin's Gitcoin
                - open source repos as original digital organizations (cathedral & bazaar)
                - how do you fund open source software
                - quadratic voting became lucky guess at how to do it
                - started doing bounties
                - democratic ways of signalling support for projects in particular communities
                    - works better in ethereum than trad science research orgs
            - april 2021 Gitcoin became a DAO
                - still learning
                - hard to go from having a large audience to having a large community
                - Orbit Model
                    - bringing people who care about a project into a position with more pull
        - Grigori
            - in many parts of article, it sounds like it's trying to find the opposite of traditional organization
                - people were fed up w/ corporate culture and decided to go in opposite direction
                - sounds like it was easier to implement and explain to people by going against traditional ways of organizing
                - people might be fed up with org politics, but they are comfortable with them
            - "leaders in DAOs are just people with more context"
                - but what about the power?
            - "everyone is a leader"
                - but what about accountablility?
                - delivering on the promises?
        - Jenna
            - "DAOs were envisioned as having automation in the center"
                - our experience: automate things that can be possibly automated but no more
            - hyperstructures, collective intelligence was interesting
                - https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html
            - questions for scott's experience
                - own experience, what's the ideal size?
                - how many prime commitments can each person take on (number of DAOs)?
                - when bounties were big last year, how much drive by activity does that draw and how much of a problem is that?
        - Shreeda
            - "alignment stronger than structure"
                - reminds her of thesis of YC: token governance not working, soft consensus is better
            - who is a leader in a network, and how is that derived from context?
                - who takes on the context wrangling?
                - BDFM
                    - how much bandwidth does anyone have to take on the context wrangling
            - learned helplessness in trad orgs?
                - where does that come from?
        - Venkat
            - YC comes at this from less of practicioners POV, we are hobbists
                - Gitcoin is successfully scale example, is also a very narrow scope
                - how does scope effect what success and it's measurements look like
            - context is available for the taking in online organizations
                - Oliver King did this in YC, contributed effectively because he could grasp the context or figure out who to ask
                - why doesn't this happen more often?
                    - biggest energy shortfcoming in YC
                        - lot of good effort for participation, but project management and coordination efforts on project timelines makes it more difficult
                        - it takes time, also a thankless effort
                            - hard to do it for the short term
                - when BDFM works it's very powerful
                    - longer tenures or tours of duties are increasingly valuable
        - Bryan
            - The more I read these types of things the more it becomes clear to me that theyâre actually talking about communes, not communities
            - Or maybe this is a bigger project than they realize, redoing government
            - You donât actually have to know the lore to be a part of a community
            - You donât really even need to feel like you belong per se, itâs more of a âam I enjoying this? Could I see myself enjoying this?
            - Often IRL communities (particularly neighborhood level) the structure (ie government) exists adjacent to the day-to-day in a separate apparatus thatâs sort of opaque until you get involved.
        - Scott
            - norm evolution definitely depends on what you're trying to do, but aligning on these norms is key (lore does help strengthen norms but may not be necessary)
            - neighborhoods are good from a conceptual POV
                - in complex research-style orgs you have to manage up and down
                - natural structure for a potluck-having / vibing neighborhood is more flat because the general interests of each member are simpler
                - naturally limited in size by being local, 'who shows up' helps set clear boundaries, whereas less organic orgs tend to have to set their own limits
            - gitcoin has stumbled into narrowness of scope, makes building context easier and allows better enactment of organizational purpose
            - structure is bad (but necessary) because you're never spending as much time and attention on the actual thing as you should
            - bounties or small contracts (e.g. w/ oliver) without clear insight into reputation are like sortition -- a random selection in hopes that the person does a good job (selecting from a superset of intrinsic + extrinsically motivated people)
            - consensus is better than voting
                - voting should be a last resort measure (goodhart's law)
                - consensus by humming is good but hard to scale (IETF style)
            - full automation (e.g. hyperstructures) is not generally possible, it comes back to people at the end of the day (we live in the world of atoms)

    - Thick Descriptions
        - Bryan
            - The Native POV
                - feels like in season 2 we got a little more mature and started appreciating the contexts around our readings
                - If I were in those shoes, with that worldview, what might I do?
                    - I think this is opposite of the empirical, systematic POV we were discussing a couple of weeks ago
            - A lot of our most interesting discussions seem to happen around "menial observations"
        - Venkat
            - Geertz is the only anthropologist he takes seriously
            - Balinese Cock FIght piece
            - Hard to learn thick descriptions
                - as hard as writing fiction
            - "faction" factual fiction
        - Shreeda
            - writing fiction resonates
        - Sachin
            - also read the Balinese Cock fight piece
            - some fiction feels like it falls in this vein
            - falls in the structuralist school of thought
            - Rene Girard might be in here too?
                - cultural symbols. etc
        - Matthew
            - https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7
            - Girard is opposed to Levi-Strauss, etc(?)
            - thick and thin of one axis of 2x2
            - thin descriptions have a validity that thick concepts don't
            - thick descriptions feels like a more enlightened way of studying culture
        - Jenna
            - duh reaction - why would you do anything else
            - 360 review inside companies
                - upwards, downwards, sideways reviews
                    - anthropology did bad things there?
        - Grigori
            - thin/thick distinction
                - case study approach in management
                - you can draw a lot of conclusions from a single case study or event
        - 
        - 
        - 
        - Venkat
            - protocol effects
                - instead of studying effects of law, thinking about the soft laws behind the hard laws
                - eigenstructure of the medium is the message
            - advanced muddling
                - messi's soccer style, leveling up muddling through

    - [MakerDAO woes](https://www.wired.com/story/makerdao-rune-christensen-decentralize/)
        - Bryan
            - > Christensen says he always planned to step aside once the DAO had become self-sufficient, but when he tried, it was always rudderless in his absence.
            - "unbundle bureaucracy" is more like atomizing bureaucracy
                - what is the appropriate level of atomization?
            - you need leadership, but you don't need management
            - Voting sounds a lot like Meta/FB board w. Zuckerberg
            - > âa real lack of intellectual rigor and consistencyâ around the concept of decentralization, which has become a clichÃ© used to signpost a general philosophy rather than a clearly defined objective.
            - Everything, everywhere comes down to participation
        - Grigori
            - purpose of the DAO was to govern stablecoin
                - this kind of thing isn't what most people do in their free time
                - analogous to participating in central bank voting, etc
                - hard for most people to wrap their heads around how these things actually work
            - what exactly was bureaucracy being unbundled from?
        - Jenna
            - if any of this is going to be used by muggles you cannot require users to have capacity for abstract thought
            - how do we make sure things stay fair?
            - always about elite capture, except the elites are always fighting amongst themselves
            - article said all DAOs aren't working, but there are examples of smaller DAOs who seem to be working well
        - Matthew
            - similar pattern w/ VGRs involvement in YC, hole if he dropped out
            - mitigation: could you remove random node from the org to test the resilience systematically? then add the node back and remove someone else?
            - decentralization as general philosophy
                - sort of like the hand-wavy way we talk about democracy
                - stickiness of phrases causes a ton of issues, lots of talking past each other
            - failure to get people to vote
                - never going to win against a fight w/ human nature
        - Sachin
            - goes well w/ Kei's prehistory of DAOs
            - started w/ idea that everything can be software protocol, but protocols alone won't solve governance
            - Maker has same gov issues as regular product orgs...hero complex, charismatic leader
                - mentioned in coordination headwinds
            - elite capture
                - cory doctorow retweeted book about clerks that work for superheroes
                - regular people clean up after the elites
            - makerdao list of proposals
                - can't comprehend them without days of review
                - nobody has time to do this, so they don't know enough to vote
                - why wasn't I asked (ftrain piece?)
            - the longer YC lasts the more core people we've amass, could survive an exit from VGR
        - Shreeda
            - members have varying levels of agency but their governance power might not reflect that, leads to low voter turnout etc 
            - how to distribute and package context to the right people in an effective way 
            - why does the founder model work so effectively / why do most successful orgs have such a strong founder presence.... a friend said to me that the job of the CEO is to stay fast to a vision even if other people flap around it 
            - tension between stipulating all this beforehand / DAO design vs enabling organic self-organization 
            - maybe it's something about self organizing systems where a goal is at a higher level of abstraction... swarm behavior maybe works because of the clarity of the goal... DAOs are more like social networks with shared values / vibes but not necessarily super clear goals;
        - Venkat
            - wonder what's happening w/ xDAI and gnosis chain?
                - should be safe
                - on his mind bc of FTX meltdown
            - organizing pattern doesn't matter
                - FTX has same problem
                    - one person with too much unaccountable problem doing unclear, obscure things
            - Maker could be on verge of meltdown?
            - Key weakness is that governance token based voting 
                - could be improved w/ mechanisms
                - but mechanisms could lead to gridlock
                - gridlock leads to a few people doing bad things
                - not a way to make governance tokens work
                - ethereum gov is NOT, will never be token based
                    - requires social consensus
                    - eth foundation plays honest broker
                - amazed that it has been working for so long
            - been sitting in on EF meetings, impressed with their inner workings
                - different set of problems comes up with soft, social consensus
            - should be able to stake tokens and use them for critical decisions
            - more things on eth will get away from gov tokens
            - once the dust settles we should read about FTX case
            - problem of charismatic leaders
                - BDFL framework
                - briefly we tried BDF-month
                    - seems like a good way to get benefits of BDFL without the great costs
                    - otherwise get caught in the pattern of nothing getting done, someone has to force things through
                - role cannot be attached to specific people
                    - BDFM should be a learnable role, anyone should be able to observe  how things work and then go off and do something themselves

                - ise jingu
                    - PA this reminds me of the Gradatim Ferociter piece in your studio
            - striking
                - this year, because we started w/ emotionally ocmpelling case studies, we approached the year with a sense of history mindset

                - fukayama's origins
                - welcome, ghosts was a mood piece
                - sense of history is more about sentiment or mood
                    - we have to come to a mood consensus re: how we feel about sense of history?
                        - happy or dark?
                - biology

                - What does the future of institutions look like?
                - How does one begin to understand and think about the behavior of complex adaptive systems?
                - What does "seeing like a network" / CAD look like?
                    - PA perhaps seeing like a network is a multi-verse like series of perspectives. Lots of images overlapping and also distinct
                - Why are institutions and rules even necessary?
        - Sachin
            - Disney call was really good
            - Messi Twitter thread - low energy mode most of the game until he needs to burst

                - governance when people don't have high agency
                - what do you do when you don't have resources
                - other things that fall into this low agency operation category
        - Jenna
            - scanning for the ones she didn't recognize, surprising amount of unknowns
            - how do we bubble up earlier pieces that weren't necessarily memorable
            - pieces
                - Ghosts

        - Â Â Â Matthew
            - Metaphors of seeing a DAO as biological organism
                - in OGS primer, failure modes
                    - do DAOs have tendency to overindex on particular images of organization? (ie organisms, machines)
            - interesting to see that even in progressive structure, they still end up circling back to solve typical organization problems (purpose, mission, vision, etc)
            - interesting that Gitcoin uses seasons to manage the cadence of governance
                - is this common in DAO space?
                - middleground between continuous integration and annual upgrades
                - drawn from new media (TV, video games, etc)
                - if someone comes in midseason, does that change the dynamic? or are the just means of delineating time.
        - Sachin
            - interesting, feels like they're reimplementing how medium-sized org work, but within a different medium
                - work needs to happen, so mission takes a back seat and you end up doing weird things with mission
            - YakC went through a cycle of this initially, trying to figure out a mission, but ended up finding it unfruitful
            - Meme: I just need to align on the goals of the organization
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FhP8KTIJkbe.png?alt=media&token=2a46b71a-b777-4844-8ba1-1dc2fbc84772)
            - having fun assigning level of goblin mode in various modes of his life
                - part of emerging org is being comfortable with things being in some level of goblin mode
            - stateless cities were easier to exist because everyone has same environment and shared sense of reality
                - how do you create stateless org when people don't recognize the same reality?
            - biology analogies idealize the Gaian emergent thing
                - not everything is emerging, some things are just collapsing
        - Venkat
            - gitcoin has good rep as an actual project for doing things
            - article is underwhelming relative to org's achievements (actually powerful mechanism)
            - quadratic mechanism has widespread gov application, very impressive compared to their governance modes
            - steward cards
                - means of counting who is actually involved in the project, necessary for this
            - voter matrix decision card
                - sort of like YakC decision channel
                - if we ever build a voting mechanism, we should have opinions attached...our prompt school can be adapted to this
            - you have to pay attention to things that seem elementary because inexperienced people might figure out weird new ways of doing things
            - algorithmic social scoring is a brand new idea, so there's lots of ground to be broken there...there are no adults in this space
            - echo Sachin's goblin mode...the world is in degenerative state but we still have to figure out how to maintain things
                - a lot of DAO culture is about figuring out when the energy and motivation are low
                - bots and templates and such are about making goblin mode better
        - Bryan
            - there is no such thing as equilibrium in nature...how would you even go about determining the ideal state? It's not like a machine, where man has built it and knows how it should be
            - Blood vessel analogy is poor because there are certain constraints we inherit from nature. 
            - Important distinction re:biology is the bits about transforming ecosystems and continual growth, not some ideal state
            - The stuff about habits is good, especially in goblin mode. What can be done to keep the ball in play? Yak collective is pretty good about this wrt meeting formats, consistency, automations, etc
            -  Participation, not engagement. Engagement feels dirty, like it's about marketing and ignores the fact that organizations should be two way, not one way. Participation should be the goal...are people showing up to hash things out, even if they aren't completely satisfied?
            - Being a Shepard/delegate that's responsible for success feels like it's getting into BDFL mode.
        - Venkat
            - once heard David Allen talk about GTD, researcher in Antartica, built around surviving in extreme environments, if things change there's immense stress. Goblin mode zombies have to do really heavy things in order to survive
                - what kind of workflow can survive not just inner degeneration, but outer degeneration?
                - The Checklist book (by surgeon...missed name). When surgeons are tired, they can't make mistakes, so they use checklists so they don't forget the basics, like washing hands
                - Yak C isn't hostile environment, but is a sort of refuge of burned out people. It's like the greeting sign at Ellis Island.
            - graph minds
                - inspired by Yak C in part
            - marketing isn't a thing you can or should do at DAOs (don't be about engagement)
                - opposite of start-up...it's a 'don't shut down' state of being
            - inviting people to join graph mind sounds like joining a cult, but people find their way into graph minds and discover something fruitful.
            - people stumble upon the boundaries of YakC and the automated processes work to put you in the proper place
            - like translating something and the immune system not rejecting
        - Sachin
            - co-CEOs
                - one person can be in goblin mode and another in high energy and they can switch modes to keep riding the wave
                - even in relationships...the adage that together you must add up to 100
        - Venkat
            - goblin portfolios...like a stock portfolio. multiple people can be in goblin mode within a good process and they can overcome goblin mode
            - sum greater than the parts at the bottom level of acceptable performance
                - weaknesses combined is less than a weakness

        - Grigori
            - False claims...unclear what the author is driving at
            - starts w/ definition of information came about in 1940s, but then went back to talk about information in 1800s
            - understand things about atoms, institutions, and blockchains, but doesn't see how the author is putting them together
        - Jenna
            - something interesting going on here
            - smart contracts are vulnerable to same things other social institutions/software is
            - non-state things on blockchain. new things will be created
        - Sachin
            - feels myopic...poor understanding of institutions but optimistic view of technology
            - interesting tangents
                - blockchain hardness...replace blockchain with any new technology and the same things can be said.
                - creating incentives w/ technology depends on creating some institution
                - atom hardness...reminds of nakatomi spaces.
                    - you can interpret a space in whatever way you want
                    - community sees it one way, but an intruder can interpret it differently
                        - something is only hard if someone chooses to interpret it differently than the majority
                        - basically what's going on w/ US Supreme Court and Clarence Thomas reinterpreting the institution
                - blockchain has already been institutionalized
                - blockchain is an instrument for techno capital to create power where they don't have power
        - Venkat
            - enjoyed the article...grasping at an intuition that's just beyond reach. makes sense why he's fumbling
            - author works for ethereal foundation
            - not sure this argument re:hardness for any technology is true. there are special things about blockchain that separate it from lithium bateries
            - schelling points...how do you coordinate without any basis for coordination? you basically have to guess or pick landmarks
                - this article is like Schelling points in time...infinite possible futures and limiting it to a more certain number.
            - blockchain code can be buggy too. BUT code that survives is code that gets managed over time
                - TCIP code is 50-60 years old, still has bugs, but it's everywhere and mostly just works for everyone
            - author's hunch is right...AIB is poking at things that the world hasn't figured it out
            - Striated and smooth, nakatomi work well here
                - moving in smooth space is more expensive than a striated one.
        - Bryan
            - Hardness vs. Antifragile
            - Random code on GitHub isn't very hard because in 20 years, you won't be able to pull it down and run it. the code might be valid, but it cannot be useful
        - Jenna
            - Do you need to be a prodigy to grok blockchain and other new technologies?
        - Venkat
            - lots of things have to be true for institutions to survive, and that's kinda the whole thing that this business of hardness is getting at. with blockchains, the same things are required, but blockchains seem to require fewer things to be true
            - Hardness by itself vs. reusable hard
                - old documents in lost language aren't reusable hard
            - measuring hardness of institutions: longevity/redundancy of core information assets (ie the Bible in Christianity)
        - Jenna
            - Gnosis has release Tabula (a mirror competitor)
        - Grigori
            - struggled w/ interplay between hardness and predictablility
                - has to do with information being fixed at a particular point in time, but that doesn't necessarily seem "hard"
                - Venkat: I think that's where the idea of cast comes into play

        - Prompt: Identify some tensions between innovation and maintenance, and provide some attributes which we could model a 2x2 for orgs of all types
        - Venkat
            - KTLO has haters
                - research people complain that budgets are eaten up by KTLO
                - firefighting eats up budgets too
                - KTLO as a category is a good thing
                    - means you've got a machine that works and needs attention to keep it working
                    - KTLO = value
            - presence of high KTLO costs means people might not be thinking critically
                - as time goes on, costs should go down because you get better at maintaining
                - "evolutionary end state of commodity design"
            - tension: does KTLO exist because people aren't pushing cost curve down enough? or is it a constrained by inertia?
                - minimal vs bloated KTLO cost as an axis
        - Gender focus on chores
            - chores as pillar of society is a character trait, gender agnostic
            - Die Hard w/ a vengeance
                - cop that does the thing because he's in the place at that time
                - Cop is a backstopping kind of job, just needs to do what needs to be done
            - KTLO as essentialist way vs characteristic perspective
            - 2x2: is it really KTLO or subjectively KTLO?
                - sometimes when people stop doing things nothing happens
                - Yak Coll welcome squad...we tried, stopped, muddling though now but it's absence doesn't kill a thing.
        - Sachin
            - Be Selfish
                - small org, people need to take on chores or other tasks that aren't enjoyable or stimulating
                - regardless of gender, people need to take these things on
                - there are things that people think can be ignored and things will be OK
                    - is it good enough to keep the ball in play?
                    - you don't need to be extensive/details to ship
                    - sometimes you get lucky when you do things like this
                - sometimes people think you need to work more to ship more, but you can ship less by doing what's only essential
                - a lot of things don't matter at a certain scale
            - KTLO
                - depends on the org...tenured ones spend more on KTLO
                - some KTLO work is can just be automated but hasn't, and people have been churning the same tasks for too long. Seems miserable for everyone.
                - some orgs do things w/out a core competency for innovation's sake
                    - they don't get the implication of new thing on existing thing
                - Chesterson's Fence
                    - if you don't know why something exists don't change it
                - Joel Spolsky on launching a product: don't completely rebuild a product and launch a slightly different version of it
        - Jenna
            - - ktlo is often misidentified, maintenance is uncool eg Why I am Not a Maker piece by Deb Chachra

- 2x2... 1 axis needed/notneeded, other axis:  __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ _?
- what actually moves the needle
- work smarter not harder ie wu wei (not really, prolly)

- yaktweeting events
- prompt school set up
- knack set up

- welcome new yaks
- rewarming existing yaks
- what is minimum viable community management
- gender divide, prolly
- another piece on "glue work" relevant
        - Grigori
            - mistake to think that innovation and KTLO are opposites
            - sometimes people just want to present the dichotomy to make a point
            - innovation is perceived as sexier than maintenance
            - value of maintenance and value of innovation isn't clearly defined
            - if you know the value of something, then you can use appropriate incentives to get those things done
            - power game dynamic over budgets, resources, etc
            - 2x2
                - innovation
        - Bryan
            - sometimes chores by themselves can be worthwhile
                - in a spiritual sense, like the rebuilding of the temple at Ice Jingu
                - good for introducing people to a particular set of skills
                    - by eliminating chores, do we prevent people from fully developing their skills
            - There's a budget/time/resources aspect
                - big budgets get you fancy KTLO solutions
                - no budgets require cobbled together solutions that just work OK
            - Doing things for the sake of doing them (enjoyable, even if not essential) is OK if you have the resources
                - it's like the high production value Lorecraft at companies. It's over the top but they have the cash to fund those endeavors
            - Backstoppers vs Explorers
                - organizations need both types. too great of an imbalance can lead to status games between maintenance and innovation
        - Jenna
            - nobody really pushes things forward at Yak Collective
            - none of the existing members have the energy...do we need to find people that have the energy?
        - Venkat
            - many things are necessary in a long-term way
                - vitamins (long-term) vs aspirin (short-term)
                - if you continuously do unhealthy things you will destroy yourself
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FozOrTyxpGs.46.45%402x.png?alt=media&token=75286581-e77d-4f0a-bb43-4becb0352166)
                - Ise Jingu is a giant vitamin
                    - lots of things become determistically necessary when you hold a particular meaning frame
        - Sachin
            - don't see a lot of vitamin-unecessary quadrant existing today
                - corporations have lots of churn in terms of people, so they don't feel like it's necessary to do the long-term vitamin style work
        - Jenna
            - often, KTLO is the wrong word
                - if something needs to happen and needs to be automated, just do it
                - if it can't be automated, then it's maintenance, and don't disparage it with KTLO term
        - Grigori
            - people that actually exercise enjoy it
            - people who don't, usually find it boring
            - apply to maintenance, if you do it the right way, you won't complain about it
            - Bryan: reminds me of backstopping
        - Venkat
            - to Jenna's point about innovation in YC being driven by Venkat
                - you have to constantly be doing little experiments, you just have to realize that most things will fail, and even if it succeeds, you don't have to exercise that option
            - at portfolio level, experiments 
            - if you're committed to continues exploration, that commitment is a KTLO activity
                - if you have a budget and 80% is devoted to maintenance (deterministic KTLO) the rest of the budget should be diversified across experiments
            - "goblin mode for too long will kill you"
            - "I think steadily doing experiments, trying new things, and doubling down on a fraction, is a vitamin at the level of individual experiments but aspirin at the level of the portfolio. It doesn't matter if this or that experiment fails or succeeds but is not doubled-down on as an option, but some yield fraction of experiments must succeed, and some further fraction of that must be doubled down on to renew/grow the org and replace what is lost through obsoloscence/entropy/decay. So at that meta level, "innovation" is a KTLO"

                            - Kinda like cryptocurrency allowed the questioning of the nature of money and the proposal of alternatives
                        - Makes the point that belonging to an imagined community should be opt-in
                            - Not a consequence of chance (who your parents happen to be, where you happen to be born and when)

                        - The idea of using a single powerful idea to drive larger coordination and divergence
                            - Typical nation states use vague caricatures of nation-ness, appeals to authority or history to invoke commitment and alignment
                            - This is much more immediate, much more felt etc.
                    - Dislike
                        - Geopolitical crystal-balling (liable to make smart people do/say/think dumb things)
                        - In-group or individual tech-media vendetta continuation
                        - Overlooks a lot of the practicalitiesâand much of the dirty work of governanceâat the nation state level (e.g. infrastructure, social care)
                        - Not everyone is a very online person (majority excluded, which constrains success)
                        - Reduces a nation state to a dashboard and a set of metrics
                        - The focus on the sole founder/strongman required to kick it off
                    - My own networked state?
                        - Most of the existing examples are positiveâvan life, nature-connected or OldEuro-vibe cities, digital nomads
                        - I'd like to see something in service of negatively impacted individuals, packs, tribes, imagined communitiesâpolitical dissidents, maybe investigative journalists, halfway homes for refugees or migrants

                    - Televangelists (and the modern church?) as an existing example of the networked state

                        - Cites the example of broadband networks consolidating in Africa
                    - Different mediums will drive and birth different types of networked states
                    - Special economic zones cited as another existing example of networked states
                    - What is the difference between something like special economic zones etc. and the proposed idea of the networked state?
                        - Why is it proposed as a new idea?
                - VGR
                    - A little bit averse because quite close to it
                    - The vision is mostly wrong, but in an interesting way
                    - The way to interpret is to see the origins of the person proposing it
                    - Reproducing the "main character" energy problem
                        - People only used to high agency propose solutions dependent on high agency
                    - Has a longer history: began with an innocuous Balaji talk at Stanford about Silicon Valley disengaging and exiting
                    - High agency, high power in tech; in larger arena (like media) found himself with voice problems and involved in conflict
                    - Can't solve problems about a certain scope with engineering and innovation only, no matter how powerful, rich etc. the main characters are
                    - Summary why he's wrong: his origin story is a bet on a wrong axiomâeverything cannot be solved by exiting and building an alternative
                        - At some point other actors/parties/stakeholders have to be acknowledged and worked with (or, worse case, war and conflict)
                        - At a certain scale, voice starts to outcompete exit
                    - Worth considering as a mind-expanding exercise, despite the apparent issues with the exit bias, reductionism etc.
    - [Why Do We Obey Rules?](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/why-do-we-obey-rules)
        - Grigori
            - distinction between rules and models
                - in the past they were the same, but models have evolved over time
            - thin rules v. thick rules is helpful
                - if rules are thick and require interpretation they can't be bent in particular ways
        - Jenna
            - title of New Yorker review
                - it's not why we obey, but when
                    - important to break rules
                    - military disregarding unjust orders
            - are there local things for breaking rules, or are the criteria for breaking rules absolutist
            - if you're a bureaucrat and meet a citizen, the citizen should be able to expect to be treated the same as every other citizen
            - schmidt quote: "definition of sovereignty is getting to decide on exceptions"
            - "radius of predictability"
                - improving that is all we can ask for
            - good abbott = BDFL
        - Matthew
            - if we were to ask what the rules of YakC are, what are they? how could they be categorized (thick vs thin)?
            - are thick or thin rules more compatible with lean or fat systems?
                - what happens when combining the different options?
            - strongly implied that rules lag behind culture and norms
                - if that's the case, why are rules established at all?
            - rules are optional that's downstream of culture, not an immutable fact of the universe
            - interesting asymmetry: takes magnitudes more effort to unmake a rule than to harshly enforce the rule
        - Sachin
            - why do some rules last longer?
                - seems like it's because they're based on interpretations.
                - thick rules have stronger believers
            - rule formation
                - a lot of conflict arise when thin rules are applied broadly in order to make things legible and easy to manage.
                - thick rules that turn into thick rules...a lot of hot button issues today are like this
            - radius of predictability
                - on day to day, it's bad because rules are based on other rules who are based on other rules. hard to really know what's going on
                - even if you figure out a rule, sometimes you miss a detail or there's someone else using a different rule so it's tough to know what's going on

            - trad philosophers are stuck in their own heads
                - philosophy is the art of making maps of experienced reality
            - lean v fat, thick v thin
                - trying to think about how thickness sheds light on modeling vs rules aspect of reality
                    - rule saying all houses must be painted red
                        - if you want to question the rule, you might nerd snipe w/ color theory, introduce ambiguity, etc
                        - if that rule is interpreted as thin rule, it will have some reference or basis
                        - models are scientific, rules are political
                            - rules can have exceptions, given by dictator-type
            - the anarch and monarch are sovereign by today's standards, but previously sovereignty was only given to the absolute ruler
            - rule of law v rule by law
                - china makes up rules and applies them, and rulers there are above the law, they are rule by law
            - what's the role of the monarch?
                - declaring the nature of reality
        - Bryan
            - Rules help legitimize a state or give a ruler sovereignty, but individuals also benefit from the certainty that rules introduce.
                - rules of thumb, heuristics help people make decisions
                - also brings stability, because people can make maps of the world and use them over and over.
            - What happens when people break rules?
                - both religion and state judicial systems recognize this and provide space for people to make amends.
                - giving that space probably helps citizens buy into the regime. If they didn't have it, they'd be more likely to attempt a takeover
            - Rules for unmaking
                - why would you have rules at all then?

    - [The Legacy of Hammurabi](https://law.mit.edu/pub/thelegacyofhammurabi)
        - Grigori
            - comparing rules and models from last week
                - rule is cut off version of a model
                    - we know that we need models, but instead we have rules, which are simplified versions of models.
                    - rules say what to do, not to do
                    - rules make assumptions of inputs and outcomes, wioth a model that describes how in translates to out
                - why is this so?
                    - rules are tools for social programming. todays reading references this
                    - simple structure allows most people to avoid the details of inputs and outomes
                    - don't think, just follow the rules
            - following the rules
                - two types of people
                    - rule followers and rule composers
                    - important to not leave out this detail
            - somebody has to write the algorithms, and they aren't the same people who are subject to the rules, makes space for movement
        - Bryan
            - no mention of blockchain or smart contracts was interesting
            - Is there space for lawlessness in all of this? Not necessarily in a malicious way, but in a new frontier kind of way
            - there will always be people who don't want to interface with rules in the moment.
                - guy sees flower, guy picks flower because he likes it, whether or not he knows what it is or whether its legal to posess
            - excessive regulations - how long do people play along before the scope of automated reg is to omuch of a burden
                - how much is too much?
        - Sachin
            - read a story about a doctor's algorithm for determining whether someone is receiving to many opioids.
                - woman had dogs (dependents) receiving prescriptions under her name, so she was flagged as an abuser instead of an honest user
            - recidivism algorithms for figuring out who likely an inmate is to commit another crime, used to decide lengths of sentence, bail price, etc
                - supposed to remove bias from legal system, but just introduces bias from whoever wrote the algorithm
            - computational law makes law easier to manage the complexity
                - "I did it because the algorithm said so"
            - encapsulated vs sysmetic complexity
                - laws have more systemic complexity than is visible on the surface
                - something with encapsulated complexity better candidates for algorithms
            - decisions are already made with these systems
                - in the future, maybe its more about understanding how to play around with the algorithm, instead of understanding how the law works
            - Robin Hood of the legal algorithms could be a thing
        - Venkat
            - author is aware of blockchain but chose not to cover. possibly because comp law is a separate field with extended history
            - valuable for blockchain people to look at this
            - to grigori's point of "who wrote the laws"
                - in developed authoritarian states, law is written to be illegible to average citizen, so they can never be in compliance
                - legal systems as a whole are written with this hostile intent in mind.
                - powerful governing authorities need to leverage against you at their discretion
                - most of the time it won't be used against you
                - US is example of this when it comes to small biz law
                    - so much compliance, licensing, regulations, etc
                    - not because a single dictator wanted rules, but instead it's bottom up
                        - barbers wanting to introduce barriers to entry via legislation
                - laws against self-repair
                - as comp law grows, understanding these issues is critical
                - worst case scenario: cabal of lawyers write self-driving car laws creating loopholes for automatic lawsuits
                - MOre power = more law distortion
            - delegated behaviors
                - smart house thermostate is delegated to control HVAC
                - could be following laws from different jurisdiction, you could be breaking a law in you locality
            - ada palmer series
                - she constructs nation-less world
                - hives have hive laws
                - people choose to be hive-less
                    - they get to choose between 3 sets of default law
                        - white law: altruistic
                        - gray law: reasonable law
                        - black law: minimal, basically an outlaw
                - Hives can set their own laws
                - we are probably headed in this direction
            - connection to APIs, cloud, SaaS systems
                - law encoded as distant cloud-based reality

                - enough people must buy in for an rules to work
            - police need to used discretion to enforce law, but is that anything other than the road to ruin?
            - "complexity is the enemy of understanding"
            - john rockefeller
                - didn't break any laws to build his empire, but they made a lot of laws because of it
            - is there any way to not end up with more complexity than humans can handle?
            - let's automate everything that can be automated for you
                - always unexpected edge cases and side effects, how can we create processes to handle exceptions
            - pubpub is a tool to explore
        - Grigori
            - another failure model
                - when legal system is underdeveloped, there is a lot to fix
                - parliament just keeps making laws and nobody has the attention span to keep up with the changes
            - difference between physical space and metaverse is huge, they need dramatically different legal systems
        - Venkat
            - if things go wrong for you, and it's obviously wrong, the right to due process is an interesting fundamental
                - indian constitution, right to constitutional remedy, one of the only rights that cannot be suspended in any emergency
                - Karl Popper meant this in Open Societies book
                    - premise: there are no absolute truths
                - in an open society, there are no absolute laws, but can be resolved by a law saying you're always entitled to legal change

            - books on founding of boston
                - guys got charter from king of england, but nothing said it had to be in england, because england never had to deal with foreign lands

            - JD: Make good rules, not too many
        - Venkat
            - that's evolution at work
            - silicon valley's whole thing is figuring out ways to work around the law in ways that nobody found before
            - code base grows more and more
                - over time, knowledge grows, so legal code must accomodate
            - you lose control if laws are automated, it's not necessarily bad
            - absolute amount of agency could grow when ceding some agency in legal realm

            - uncap, how property rights come into play
            - Sarah Perry, Frontierland piece
                - lore of the frontier is different from how it was originally defined by Frederick Turner

            - if it wasn't so wild, what was?
                - something european, what were the murder rates in London in a given year during the same time period.
            - keeping track of crime is a function of the state. no state, no records.

            - we've lost a lot of local knowledge to global knowledge
            - the three patterns of cultural transmission aren't celebrated today
                - we have a distrust of experts
                - there's a fetish with youth
                - diversity is a pillar
            - we're in a period of questioning everything
                - critical analyusis of culture is everywhere
                - we don't really take cultural assumptions at face value
            - question: how do we properly shepard culture so that it evolves at an appropriate pace?
        - Grigori
            - Culture not coded properly
                -  rules and taboos donât contain sufficient information
            - to transmit culture
                - you need a leader, someone who is trusted
                - you donât want to ignore directions
            - in culture, most causes and effects are very unclear
                - effects can come back a long time after the cause
                - Culture needs top down AND bottom up

            - imitation: surprised mirror neurons didn't come up.

                - can't imitate each other the same online v IRL
            - ongoing question
            - collaboration v cooperation v competition
            - a growing sense of niceness and compassion for each other is the underlying driver for whether things get better

            - caribou example has been disproven
            - doubting the narrative of cause-effect of culture
            - familial taboo around food that he still follows instinctively
            - Chesterton's fence
                - don't get rid of things until you know why they exist
                - applies to a lot of modern systems
                    - when you join a new company, you have so many questions about why things are
                    - first instinct is abandon those things or evolve them
                    - but those things could be embedded in fabric of org
            - need authority, need to see other people doing the same thing
            - He came to US on regular permanent visa, which few people go through the trouble of doing, but he knew lots of people who'd already done it, so it felt reasonable for him to do
                - things are publicly knowable, but there's a lot more to understand something intuitively
        - Venkat
            - why and how cultural evolution transmission would've changed in the last century
                - the three mechanisms
                    - old people, experts, people like you
                    - speed of change has happened so fast that it's intragenerational instead of intergenerational. you can't learn from yourself 20 years ago. those behaviors are no longer adaptive
            - self-consciously imitate someone younger
                - cache invalidation
                - learned behaviors can be dropped, new ones can be picked up
            - people like you have the same problems as you
                - we all live in isolated villages
                - but we've all moved to environments that are completely different from villages
                - your life can be dependent on non-local things (like chinese supply chains)
                - causal pattern behind of adaptiveness of seeking diversity
                - the definition of who is like you has shifted
                    - no longer demographic-based, but lifestyle or abilities-based
                - editor's note: this is the whole basis for the yak collective
            - expertise in the sense of smart, educated, credentialed people doesn't make sense
                - expertise in cultural aspect is learning from a long history of humans
                - reversion to older patterns
                    - credentialed, downloaded education + patched has shifted to a system more like looking around you and seeing who's plugged themselves into modern traditions
                    - he's a blogger, and knows the whole ecosystem well, but it's all unconscious and basically useless. it's hard to teach too
                - expertise is being immersed in the right place in time
            - review feels like an overcompensation for the Rationalist ethos
            - everything has accelerated, which means basis for cultural evolution has shifted
                - you can't afford to let evolution become unconscious
                - ask how exactly is evolution going on?
                    - what's hangover?
                    - which parts make sense today

                - resisting acceleration
                - Hannah Arendt-ish
                - Analysis is solid but not strongly original

            - Spiritually in Ivan Illich Convivial lines of thinking
                - not convinced that acceleration is bad, including socially
                - intergenerational things might not be good
                - acceleration is stressful
                    - can be managed though
                    - no effective response
            - Catastrophic ways out might be the only way to stop acceleration
        - Sachin
            - you become more unhappy looking for a solution to accelerationism
            - https://jonathanrexallen.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/hegels-unhappy-consciousness/
            - frenetic standstill is academic term for goblin mode
            - lots of these ideas are like Twitter memes
            - Discomfort around uncertainty
                - in the west, everything was predictable, but has changed in the last decade
                - must be a way to become more comfortable with uncertainty
                - doing things proactively instead of under bad circumstance
            - venkat's thread about looking to your own past for guidance on how to act in the present

                - advice is often useless 
        - Matthew
            - prefers the term "motion" over acceleration
                - feels more neutral
                - acceleration assumes forward motion, progression
            - Thomas (Nail?)

            - liquid modernity, flow-like concept
            - alienation in modern culture
                - rate of change experienced by individual vs group
                - cultures are changing faster than the individual can?
                - or have individual and culture been decoupled and moving at different rates?
            - stamping out acceleration altogether, vs. stepping away from acceleration and hold on for dear life.
            - redistribute motion between individual and group
            - we're exposed to lots of information, does that effect how we experience the rate of change?

                - "The bad news is youâre falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, thereâs no ground."
            - useful to have early adopters and laggards
                - always makes sure we push things forward while having survivors
            - some people deal with rug pulls better than others
            - "life is one rug pull after another. it gets easier the sooner you learn to make peace with that"
            - fluid in your conception of work and life, accepting change
        - Grigori
            - acceleration is not necessarily bad
                - it's neither good or bad, actually
                - going to happen whether you like it or not
            - communist manifesto says basically the same thing as this reading
            - it's just more comfortable to live in a stable environment, but it's not a given
            - success is legible, we can see when people are doing big, important things
            - what can we do?
                - condition ourselves to be more comfortable w/ acceleration
                - OR become a force of acceleration and carry forward other people with us.
                - focus more on doing things that are actively new.
                - don't reduce any motion to something null
        - Dave
            - governance is critical to managing acceleration

                - not just for fun, but out of necessity
        - Bryan
            - What are we accelerating towards?
                - likes Matthew's framing of motion instead
                - reminded of Danes vs. Saxons, where Saxons were obviously technologically superior, and everyone knew it
                    - also: printing press, internet, other innovations where there was hyperacceleration
            - Lots of focus on the tools and systems enabling accelerations, not much on the actual people/groups pushing on the accelerator
                - Gutenberg vs. Luther, who made the bigger impact?
            - Could continous motion (without visible forward progress) be the antidote to acceleration?
                - Ise Jingu, Bangladeshi Charlands
                    - people who habitually rebuilding their environments, so they're always doing something, but never really going anywhere.

        - **Impact Networks**
            - sachin
                - network leadership model isnât surprising
                    - modern companies work in this hub-and-spoke manner
                        - are they decentralized?
                - you donât hear a lot about amazonâs executive team
                    - clones of Jeff Bezos, with similar framework of thought
                    - theyâre network leaders
                - decentralized orgs are different
                    - instead of everyone alignment, if you have network leaders that are loosely aligned but pursuing their own things, thatâs a good model for decentralization
                - avoiding authoritative decision making, critical hubs
                    - feels unavoidable regardless of whether network is centralized or decentralized
                    - there are people that, if removed from network, the network falls apart
                    - something cannot emerge from nothing
                - a lot of writing in this space casts hierarchy as a problem
            - Grigori
                - this is pretty obvious by now, yet we donât do it the way the author describes
                    - applies to a lot of network orgs
                    - easy to read, hard to implement
                - no evidence that hub and spoke to network org is even possible, no examples
                - strong pull in hierarchical structure
                    - if you are top or center of hub, there are a lot of personal risks in ceding authority
                    - multi-hub
                        - every person here feels the same wayâ¦not wanting to give up authority
                - There are good hierarchies that do things right
                - if you are undecided between hierarchy and network, nothing good happens
                - amazon isnât a multihued, itâs a well-functioning hierarchy
            - Dave
                - agree w/ grigori about easy pull to hierarchy
                - always a power curves, someone is always much much better than everyone else
                - written to people who are just going over the basics
            - Bryan
                - itâs not hierarchy vs network, itâs both
                    - hierarchy naturally happens, it should be embraced, and those with authority would be wise to be good network leaders
                - the question is, how do you create strong networks? it seems like a lot of networks are very weak, and therefore not all that useful
                - without hierarchy, you end up with lots of peer-to-peer competition for status, which distracts from the objectives.
                    - having managers creates more of a cooperative-competitive environment
            - Jenna
                - getting booster, impressed by CVS organization
                - agree that thereâs nothing new
                - whoâs his audience
                    - lots of young people joining DAOs, this is new for them
                    - in that case, this is a nice writeup
                - how do we behave?
                    - doesnât cover this point
                    - weâre always status seeking, how do you work around this simple biological fact

            - The Little Prince
                - commanding things and them happening
        - Matthew
            - do each of the philosophies tend to prioritize the immutability of different parts of the contingency trio?
            - if you assume that one part of the trio (ie people) is a fixed variable, you get a nice platform to experiment with the other two.
                - systematically investigate how things can be tinkered with
            - constant emphasis on meaning and narrative
                - philosophy of work inevitably degenerates into the same types of debate as philosophy of life
            - continuously surprised by the narrative component of work
        - Sachin
            - wanted to hear more about how much coordination is required
                - scientists needed less coordination, so they communicated less, so the reduced structure works for them
                - Stockton group in the study had low coordination headwinds
            - Bezos: more communication indicates dysfunction
            - working in an office vs remote
                - being present together builds trust, rapport, etc in informal ways
                - remote work tends to be very formal, structured communication
            - coordination headwinds on start-ups
                - as you grow you need more structure and more communication
            - time horizons
                - shorter term "sprints" vs longer term narratives and roadmaps in future quarters
        - Venkat
            - when people give an "it depends" answer, it means that people haven't thought much about the problem
                - but occasionally that answer means the author understands the depth behind the topic
            - article represents good solid research in org theory
                - n=1 experience has low confidence, but this kind of article takes those individual intuitions and solidifies them w/ research
            - had experience in his phd with an advisor that had strong top-down managerial tendencies
            - 2nd advisor was also top-down as a backstop tendency until the student proves that they can drive themselves
            - wrote a bunch of articles as he was learning about management in mid 2000s
                - managed small team in a startup-y environment that was in a larger org
                - a manager needs to understand the type x or y tendencies of their employees and tailor managerial approach accordingly
            - instincts about managing
                - huge part is empathy and attunement, it can be harder to have empathy with people who are demographically and psychographically different than the manager.
            - worked with odesk (upwork) to work on task management tools
                - "hirer managing", big brothers management, very theory X
        - Bryan
            - individual motivation
                - there's a lot more to satisfaction than competence
                    - really a blend of things: the work itself, autonomy, achievement, people, purpose, etc
                - Maslow wrote a theory Z after this was published, talking more about self-actualization
                - People can be type Y, but inside a type X organization
                    - they can cross the boundary as they get worn down by top-down management
                    - crossing into type Y is possible, but requires lots of work and probably different organization
            - innovation in organization
                - been reading Drucker's Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
                    - talks about the necessity of separating innovation from typical operations
                        - innovation is type Y, operation is type x
                - Organization cannot be divorced from function. 
                    - they work together to create ideal working environments

                    - product team was hands off approach
                    - rest of org needed lots of top-down, even those who weren't even his subordinates
                - lots of communication between an individual team and the rest of the org
                - people find ways to become immune to top-down management
        - Jenna
            - an entrepreneur is someone who can get other people to do things for them

            - Design principles
                - how do they get leveraged by different types of people
                - difference between someone with low agency and high agency
                    - if you're low agency, how would you put some of the principles for sustainable hypercomplexity into use?
                    - high agency people are in the position to fuck around and find out
                - principles have an inherent kindness
                - tina ideologies seem to be harsh and uncompromising
                    - also claim to be timeless and eternal

        - Sachin
            - tweaking the system at an axiomiatic level seems analogous to Muddling Through
            - Tech world in last couple of decades was dominated by TINA ideologies
                - ie software eating the world
            - Same crowd now trying to figure out hypercomplexity things

            - Annotation for the venn diagram
                - the point is that the states w/ all 3 are more stable
                    - more stable than what?
                    - more stable than primative societies?
                - is stability a desired quality?

                            - end result in the short term is the same, but different in long run
                - if someone buys into this model for decision making, how immutable is their idea of the state?
                - Reading Ian McGilcrist, thinking that there are many things we take as foundational and immutable that are actually very malleable
                    - things that can be quickly updated

        - Shreeda
            - confused about rule of law and accountability
                - accountability needs a balancing function
                - but what does rule of law actually mean
            - what's happening in the US right now?
                - does accountability exist?

            - In 90s FF was popular, but in 00s he started to decline, now it's surging again
            - These 2 volumes fall into the point in time where FF was wrestling with "the history of the end of history"
            - VGR might've been more confident that it was true
            - To Shreeda
                - rule of law is a book full of laws
                - accountability is the mechanism for holding leaders to some standards
                - FF makes subtle distinction
                    - rule of law v rule by law
                        - by law, rules exist, there are certain people who are above the law
                        - of law, rules are strong, and no leader is strong enough to be above them
            - FF deprecated Greek history of democracy and inherited ideas from the high middle ages
                - ancient greece is bad example
                - between 900-1300 AD in europe is good one
                    - magna carta, rise of Christianity
            - Cities played a huge role in accountabiltiy

        - Sachin
            - Problems started in the 60s w/ New Left policy
            - Feels hard to be involved in any interface with a system at a local level
                - ie how cities make decisions
                - did something change in 60s and 70s for people to get engaged in community politics
            - Hypercomplexity
                - since your actions may not be immediately correlated with something that happens around you (ie things happening in china), things are hard to comprehend
        - Shreeda
            - working class can only be spoken to by republicans, it seems
        - Venkat
            - economic side of software eating the world
                - neoliberal era from 1980s to today was the best kind of slouching towards utopia
                - Delong himself is ambivalent to neoliberalism
                    - something broke in 1970s
            - this is economics version of Richard Gabriels thesis
                - all the people who plan beautiful software end up failing
                - people who half-assed the planning seem to take off
                - Gabriel hates his own insight, like delong
                    - wishes it wasn't the case that worse is better but realizes that it is
                - Venkat likes what's actually happening over what should be happening
            - 1970s thing is interesting
                - new left moved up Maslow's hierarchy towards self-actualization
                - premature to give up on improving material things
                - not monocasual phenomenon
            - Read review of bowling alone
                - social and cultural life broke around this time too
                - that happened naturally, not related to left policy
            - 1974 paper, Danny Rogers(?)
                - factory automation replaced a lot of people in the 70s
                - capital share of income grew, labor share collapsed
            - globalization and containerization
                - not just that work went to china, but that shipping jobs required to bring stuff back to US got automated too (ports, ship hands, etc)wer
        - Grigori 
            - interesting part is hypercomplexity 
                - adding even more complexity on top to make the story even more global by adding bits from places around the world
                    - but really are these all the same stories?
                        - doubtful
                        - russia zigs when the world zags
                        - Soviet Union collapsed but it is not a part of the story
                        - space devoted to India is small
                        - how did china respond to influx of jobs during this period?
            - interesting to see triangle of big gov, big labor, big business
                - no longer have big labor, really
                - nice to have a triangle, without the third leg things get wobbly
        - Jenna
            - intrigued that research labs where part of the trio of innovations
            - squad goals
                - small groups coming together
            - we haven't figured something out between free market and managed economy
            - something cool about envisioning qualities of a future without knowing how we'll get there
            - "Muddling towards utopia"
            - what do we do about labor's loss of power?
                - chop wood, carry water. do your own chores
                - valuing simple labor over bullshit jobs
            - old footage of railroad workers loading ice on trains to California
        - Bryan
            - stories and interpreted history of economics is interesting
                - has huge bearing on economic policy
                - but the stories are still ongoing, so it's hard to say what is and what isn't
            - "production and plenty" is prerequisite for utopia, but cannot be guaranteed.
                - if covid was x% more deadly and systems fell apart, would that have been a swift end to neoliberalism order
            - Economic keep the lights on
                - new left abandoned material gains in favor of cultural ones, and in effect stopped maintaining the maachines
                - there's a need for people to continue incremental improvements, keep the gears oiled, etc
            - Alt right following new left playbook, worrying solely about culture and not keeping tabs on the working class
        - Sachin
            - labor organizations haven't evolved like other organizations, no innovation
            - when he talks to people that work in city planning
                - little talk about technology and it's impact on civic stuff
            - anti-trust hasn't been updated to apply to tech cos
                - if it benefits the customer its not anti-trust, good defense against legal system
                - people in politics don't pay much attention to tech so it's tough for them to grok how it actually impacts policy
        - Venkat
            - has anyone read Didion's Slouching for Bethlehem?
                - inspiration for this essay
                - about 60s and 70s California and it's dysfunction
                - worth finding a review
        - Jenna
            - likes tracking the turning points, where things started to go wrong
- Summary of readings 21-22
    - Bryan 
        - Cory Doctrow disney article - lore - governance ideas
        - idea mazes (future reading), Zapatistas article and Northern Syria article 
        - long arc of governance, you have to survive before you have something to govern. 
    - Grigori
        - Dillemmas in general theory of planning - it can be used as a springboard to learn about the future of planning and what they are thinking of planning right now. 
        - would be good to read about planning and what that looks like in the current world 
    - Jenna
        - wishlist: spaced repetition bot to resurface articles and notes that we have to keep them current in our headspace 
        - future reading on non grifty parts of the DAO space and review of those 
            - eg https://www.dorg.tech/ | https://blog.dorg.tech/ | https://docs.dorg.tech/workflows/doing-internal-work#the-swarm
    - Matthew 
        - readings - slide deck about co-ordination headwinds, rock paper scissors (bio reading)
        - potential future track - fundamental governance constraints - extrapolating from the above readings
        - is there an equivalent for modern/complex governance views 
    - Sachin 
        - ise jingu - refer to it a lot in terms of maintenance, and adapting to new conditions, and also applies in terms of preserving process knowledge
        - messi  - feels like how yc operates and to an extend how people in the yc operate on an individual level also fall somewhere on that spectrum
        - future topics
        - prompt school
        - anything else that I've been thinking about - prehistory of some of the ideas we have been discussing, early 20th century -
    - Venkat 
        - Ise Jingu - renewal and long termism being the same problem. Normally you think about it in terms of something for 10K years, Ise Jingu uses the idea of being regenerative. 
        - nobody is doing that type of thinking. corporations think in 3-5 year terms, no one thinks in the 20-30 year terms
        - "wood decays but the idea does not"
        - Rock paper scissors - Hobbesian and Gaian felt very simplistic and perhaps naive, rock paper scissors. what are some non cartoon ways of thinking about evolution 
        - blockchain readings back to this track 
        - historical case studies vs theoretical and conceptual evolution. what are conceptual leaps or technological leaps that create new governance ideas

            - Sachin
                - articulate signals are external if you want to attract external people - projects themselves have articulate goals 
                - and if the project is not able to articulate it then it kind of fails 
                - the metaphors seem interchangeable - funnels and tubes - something can be both a tube and a funnel. Or tubes can accelerate funnels or create new types of funnels 
                - Slower tubes - encourage a different type of activity 
            - Grigori
                - does not apply to all types of scaling 
                - YakC feels like monoculture 
            - Venkat 
                - Cities dont have strong goals and scaling creates optionality
                - During scaling for companies the optionality goes down 
                - Developing an aversion to funnels altogether 
            - Bryan
                - We are good at tubes, we are bad at funnels 
                - People join - how do we direct people towards things that they want 
                - "Ships passing in the night" 
                - Turning tubes into spaces generally fail and probably not a good heuristic 
                - common bias of the last 15-20 years towards illegibility and not legibility. Can metrics be done in a smarter way? 
        - [encapsulated vs systemic complexity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html)
            - when does encapsulated become system - sometimes it happens when the problem is punted down 
            - encapsulated vs systemic - product decisions, the choice seems to be between encapsulated vs systemic complexity. computer vision example 
            - when do microservices run into issue - when there is interaction - and I think there is distrust that is created in a system encapsulated 
            - distrust of encapsulated 
            - systemic complexity - could be caused by heroic actions
            - cities - encapuslate 
            - interactions between subsystems causes enca
            - worrying about encapsulated complexity - time and capital demands, affected by other factors - reason DAOs or we havent run into the problem 
            - Brian 
                - similar to monolithic software vs microservices. monoliths have more co-ordination issues. 
                - lack of local knowledge causes systemic complexity
            - Venkat 
                - complicated vs complex
                - economy is complex - fuzzy boundary
                - jet engine - complicated - clearly defined interfaces
                - optimization -> convex function defined on a complex set 
                - complicated systems are optimizable because their boundaries are defined 
                - if you do complicated systems with fixed boundaries, you are creating time bombs 
                - the perfectionists - book on airbus engine?
                - conways law - product structure will mimic conweys law - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law
            - Grigori
                - if its a two person team, all the complexity is encapsulated 
                - when does it become systemic 
            - Vijay
                - your mental model did not incorporate all possible changes (the interface changes)
            - Kiran
            - Kartik (from chat)
                - Complicated vs complex reminds me of https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy
                - Looking through a deployment lens:
                    - The success of microservices is entirely due to deployment 
concerns. Microservices lean into Conway's Law by allowing teams to deploy on independent schedules. The interfaces aren't necessarily better in microservices, but by existing they turn into Schelling Points. People start to rely on them, and so the people who maintain them start to care about not breaking them.
                    - Vitalik says we should tend to try to encapsulate complexity, but that grants a lot of political power to the people who can make changes inside the encapsulation boundary.
        - [Biodiversity may thrive through games of rock paper scissors](https://www.quantamagazine.org/biodiversity-may-thrive-through-games-of-rock-paper-scissors-20200305/) 
            - 
                - What they have found is that over time, rock-paper-scissors may enable many species to coexist in the same area by cycling in and out of dominance.
                - reminded me of the clueless coming to power in organizations that are extremely large - iron law of bureacracy - In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely.
                - Kropotkin mutual aid - written around the same time as Darwin
                - In a DAO is there any direct competition? or how would it work in the case of a DAO - may be it cycles through to autonomous organization when no one is around 
                - and if survival is not an issue what happens - civilization style governance? just based on memes and culture wars? 
                - impact of local environment 
                - If species A starts to go extinct, she explained, species B might evolve in such a way that A can recover. This idea also works in reverse.
                - âA species doesnât always have to be the best. It just has to have enough times where it can be sufficiently good that it can weather the bad years,â - muddling through
                - species does not go exist because of just local environment changing 
                - how does it apply to humans?jobs and governance - more power on the side of the individual?
                - what about emergent phenomenon with more conscious intent ?
                - Bryan
                    - cycling of powers reminded of professional sports teams and how they cycle through good phases and bad phases
                - Grigori
                    - Similar rock paper scissors dynamics in management. For example company with three equally powerful founders is not stable. somebody has to run it even if it has three owners. Starts with someone volunteering without explicit competition. another dominant players comes in when the first one makes a big mistake. since the other two have untouched reputation, they see themselves as a stable system. goes on until everyone is a sore loser. at this point competition sets in because of this dynamic. 
                - Kartik
                    - connection: red queen theory. genetically uniform populations are susceptible to parasites. sexual reproduction makes populations more biodiverse within a single species
                    - connection: fermi paradox - we tend to focus on the idea that ["technology implies belligerence"](http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-21-07-09-03-soc) but biodiversity may be responsible for a more optimistic universe 
                    - connection: [core wars](https://gamasutra.com/view/news/22822/Analysis_Corewar__The_Ultimate_Video_Game.php) is designed for 3 kinds of strategies: replicator/scanner/bomber. What does a game/governance model designed for 4 strategies look like?
                - Kiran
                    - viewed mental model of a system as hiearchial with chaos induced. 
                - Venkat
                    - CRIPSR - you can make dna modifications to produce aritificial insulin but it reverts back to its original state, not a stable evolutionary strategy. 
                    - arrows theorem?impossibility of selecting the right candidate in a democratic election 
                    - survival of the stupidest - if they a co-operate in a smarter way could win over the smarter person
                    - lot of interesting phenomenon that happens when we go from two to three
                    - de-desertifying soil is really hard. roots of grass have complex ecosystem specific to a terrain. chances of success are low if its not adopted to a particular area 
                    - other examples 
                - Matthew
                    - Main thing I noticed is that biodiversity/ecosystems science/thinking starts from a point of dynamism and motion, which turns out to be way more robust than other disciplines which start from stasis and stillness. The other thing I was wondering related to the Primer archetypes. Is there a rock-paper-scissors mechanic between them (e.g. does Gaia beat Muddler?), and are there longer-range cycles of dominance involving the archetypes (e.g. does Citadel dominate in wartime, Gaia in times of prosperity)?

The other thing, based on Venkat's mention of instability, reminds me of something related to John Boyd. Deliberately engineered instability gave F15/16 its agility; can unstable ecosystems be deliberately created for certain situations?

                    - it seems there already is shared language, culture and metaphors which helped Zapatista do this
                    - the contrast of zapatista vs neoliberalism is pretty interesting. wonder if land reform would have worked in India if neoliberalism worked

            - TheÂ [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty)Â was abolished.

            - effect of the french mandate -  led to formation of these regions?
            - makes me think of axis powers and allies as level one chains and the rest of the countries, including third block are kind of like level 2. Where would DAOs be? Level 3 or 4.
            - third block
            - "For a former diplomat like me, I found it confusing: I kept looking for a hierarchy, the singular leader, or signs of a government line, when, in fact, there was none; there were just groups. There was none of that stifling obedience to the party, or the obsequious deference to the "big man"âa form of government all too evident just across the borders, in Turkey to the north, and the Kurdish regional government of Iraq to the south. The confident assertiveness of young people was striking. - seems kind of hobbesian
            - The main sources of revenue for the autonomous region have been presented as: 1. Public properties such as grain silos and oil and gas in the Jazira Region, 2. Local taxation and customs fees taken at the border crossings, 3. Service delivery, 4. Remittances from Iraq and Turkey, and 5. Local donation

                - you can get centralized as much as you want, but if you have a hostile neighbor then the centralized system kind of falls apart

                - realizing what is a good idea to change and what are things that cannot be changed is a big part of governance

                - energy levels of different projects - impressive that we meet every friday. got over the hurdle of having something worth spending time on. On the flip side, having the energy to get the paper done which is a high energy mode is harder. 
                - yak collective has a hobbyist approach that is different from amateur or pro
            - Matthew
                - leaving an artefact/time capsule of your experience 
                - putting pull requests on everything is interesting.
                - Having incentives aligned is needed for something like an "open" approach work
                - tension in the article between doing something vs realizing what is uncontrollable. how big of factor this is is unclear

            - Venkat 
                - this one is written by a low agency rank and file person, who are not as constrained. First instinct was to be slightly bored by it. 
                - never hear this perspective anymore. 
                - For most people most of the things are unchangeable in the world, they see the universe as a spectator sport 
                - 2X2. agency vs constraint. 
                - whats unique about github - the pull request 
                - YC - there is literally no way to make somebody do something

        - Messi thread 
            - Sachin
                - Messi's style of play has to be complimented with a specific strategy that works for messi. which means other players have to sort of sacrifice or play a different role

                - longer he goes in his career - has the charismatic effect - more defenders engage him which leads to srendipity for other players in other parts of the pitch and zemblanity for the opposition

                - Messi was sick as a child and had lactic acid build up fast
                - Alexander technique/non judgemental awarness is curative

                - modern war is more like soccer and older war is more like american football 
                - working around energy patterns. - similar to wind in the willows. instead of starting with a goal, start with what you are capable.

            - Sachin
                - âwill post my comments since I likely wonât stay on for the call. I find such trad takes personally amusing since I grew up in a town that was full of small shops and stores that rapidly urbanized and gave way to fancier stores/restaurants, and everyone was really excited about it. I think thatâs the primary difference Iâve noticed between the west and the developing world. Growing up in India, you had fewer resources and money but the tempo/mood of the narrative was clearly upward , you could see things changing around you and people were mostly excited for it. While after I moved to the US, Iâve access to more resources and money but it feels like I came in at the end of something and people are nostalgic for somethingâ

                    - the future is already here, just on an unevenly distributed vibe

                    - modes of organization will remain unindexed and inaccessible beyond a case study
                - Unknown-unknowns
                    - ways of organizing we donât even know about
                - Removing the informalities
                    - they donât get destroyed, they just get shifted elsewhere
                    - cannot really suppress them, the underground will always exist
                - Work being out of view
                    - almost at the beginning of the end of the impact of the Internet revolution
                    - the primary way we interact w/ computers is a mouse, but the possibility of interaction is near infinite

                - Touched on subject DAOs have been thinking about

                            - Street food culture
                                - itâs mostly uninnovativeâ¦vendors copy and thereâs nothing new for decades
                            - new things have high failure rate
                                - this holds people back
                        - Are there areas in the world good at this?

                    - humans live short time
                    - living memory is short
                    - small scale things get forgotten quickly
                    - important to preserve informal memories
                    - the internet expires content. domains expire. dead people and organizations stop paying to keep artifacts alive. curators reframe and rewrite history. 
                - Sarris has balance of restorative nostalgia and reflective nostalgia
                - Venkat skeptical of people who are poetically nostalgic. âSoft demagogueryâ

                    - Can we do idea mazes in the regular world?
                    - Whatâs the idea maze of New York street food?
                        - to do it, youâd need to 	know the history of NY street food
                - Meredith
                    - idea mazes arenât something people actively doâ¦seems like people just absorb them
                - Venkat
                    - half dozen founders that are idea mazes
                    - Conor from Roam did this
                    - if you donât absorb idea maze, chances of success are low
                - Matt
                    - âOn idea mazes: thereâs like a barren middle ground? You either know the space (in the present and historically) organically, or youâve got no effing clue and project such a strong reality distortion field that unknowledge doesnât matter. The middle ground (e.g. someone mechanically identifying an opportunity and trying to go to market)â

        - [Jesuits ](https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/jesuit/)
            - Bryan
                - trust in the jesuit system is high, didnt need to be watched. They trusted that other jesuits were doing the same thing as they were doing. 
                - what would not talking to peers look like in the internet world?  What does changing the frequency of activity mean?
                - Jesuits were good at PR - printing press
                - instance of path dependence - would the jesuits have existed in a place without the other infrastructure that existed around them? right people at the right place in the right time
                - bias on observing/orienting vs not acting 
            - Grigori
                - they had ambitious goals, because it clashed with traditional order they found ways to hide it 
                - The development of the school was very fast for the time in which it was developed 
                - they were very strict most of the time. 
                - the system that made them spread very fast seems unclear. Interested to know more about what happened initially 
                - they used printing press, but it does not follow from the article that competing movements did not use it?
            - Jenna
                - the letters when they arrived - how are the documents controlled, distributed, who decided what to print. internal decision making is unclear 
                - async model - has a lot of writing/documenting involved. would be interesting to see if it comes out as product output in some way 
            - Matthew 
                - first time reading about jesuits was - novel about jesuits??
                - they were providing legibility as a service - emphasis on translating documents, interfacing between different regions, describing what they were seeing. And thats what sucked a lot of people in 
                - royal patronage helped them to get to the boundaries of the empire or liminal spaces between them. wonder how being associated with the state changed it. what is akin to royal patronage that jesuits had?
                - tendency to document --> similar to everything being async by default. 
            - Venkat 
                - went to a jesuit school
                - couple of things that didnt come through -  in the period of printing press -> westaphalia, jesuits were late adopters to this. Pamphlet wars 
                - they became advisers for ...
                - jesuits were good at getting close to the rulers and becoming the consultant equivalents of the time. They were more about political influence rather than religious
                - jesuits - do most of things in the ears of rulers and not talk directly as much publicly 
                - reason they were travellers - complimenting the printing press - preventing the info from getting in the hands of others 
                - they had access to capital 
                - had a lot of local autonomy but not decentralized. big capital played a big role in projects 
                - reasons async communications worked - most of it was about money. Important things went through central authority 
                - they did a lot of predictive processing - send out advisory blog posts 
                - yak school operating more in that mode than we realize. letter writing was much more commmon and frequent. 6 mail deliveries a day. increased in tempo 
                - people spend hours reading and responding to letters
                - adapting to the medium.if there are long time delays you keep communicating hoping that some of it is useful. 
                - lot of military operations have to unfold in radio silence. same strategy. high level autonomy for local commanders. commanders set overall goal, local commanders have smaller goals and they have contracted agreements between them.  similar to how the jesuits do it. overall mission was clear - spread the religions. filling in the details would be not predictable exactly 
        - Commons 
            - Sachin
                - does not seem like it applies to platforms, unsure if it applies to web3
                - does it even apply in terms of governance of cities and such
                - it also seems away from the commons - the way we operate 
                - local circumstances rules apply 
            - Grigori 
                - it does not describe what we have here, it would benefit us if we could compile something along the lines of 8 principles 
                - none of these really apply to yak collective 
            - Bryan
                - probably not much theres something extremely negative that someone can do to harm the common resources we have
                - we have the option of easily leaving 
                - renegotiate when something comes up 
            - Venkat 
                - Elinor Ostrom - nobel winning economist, is at the socialist side of things
                - Amartya Sen 
                - probably all 8 should be spectrums 
                - applying it to public internet - large models scrape the entire internet - but it fails in that too
                - it does not mean that public internet is not good commons 
            - Jenna
                - good guidelines for things that we want to do if conflict comes up 
                - assume good actors vs assume bad actors (Lunar punk??). in cases where there are bad actors - its not tragedy of commons but different problem 
                - https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720/982314638056251412 - commons example?
        - [Bulldozer vs Vetocracy ](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html)
            - having a fixed limit for processes that are put in place - such as the shrine of ise jingu example. The limit should perhaps be more than or exactly one generation perhaps. so that it avoids sociopathic incentives to a certain extent 
            - cases where the vetocratic mechanism is used to stifle something that could actually be more useful with a bulldozer 
            - recognizing when to be vetocratic vs when to be bulldozer is hard - requires
            - Venkat 
                - Fukuyama - vetocracy - anything can be blocked at 6 levels. Effectively the way things get sorted out is people go to the courts and get things settled there. 
                - individual european countries are not like but other governance structures took ideas from this 
                - baramdipity?? there is serendipity but there is an external force that is trying to change to to zemblanity environment 
                - bulldozer thinking - its pretty old, vetocracy is a newer idea. 
                - yak collective bull dozer bias -- DAOs generally have vetocracy bias - DAOs have a knob from bulldozer to vetocracy. system 
                - code management - people went from thinking of code as something that they own to something that is more open/communal, until 5-6 years, the onboarding process for new employees - on the first day you were supposed to push something into production 
                - go from individual vetocracy to collective bulldozer (anyone can change anything), if you are not competent, you may destroy something 
            - Grigori
                - "we have a pretty huge bulldozer in our country" that is fighting against vetocracy
                - it is a 30,000 foot view on whats going in DAO or society, it can be abstracted down to lower layers as well 
                - current state of yc - much more important to find more bulldozers and not to distract by trying to regulate - finding the bulldozers itself is not easy
            - Jenna
                - making a distinction between what regime would I want to live under vs where I myself am a regime or making the regime
                - adjectives - bulldozery vs vetocractic 
        - [The Art of Community](https://reason.com/1972/04/01/the-art-of-community/)
            - Grigori
                - Old book with a different context.
                - A lot has changed, the author's version of community is different from what an antropologist's would be.
                - Not what a community is, but what a community can do?
                    - what are the use cases of a community?
                        - maximizing rent is not an appropriate answer
            - Jenna
                - Sarah Taber's Twitter threads: we need a better understanding of how rural communities work: https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1539438501317513216
            - Matthew
                - mixed-use urban development meme "it's all good"
                - Conception of community as a nested stack that feeds on one and other
                    - internet as stack w/ layers
                        - app layer isn't fixed, constantly moving target
                            - community is the same way. changes as we become more sophisticated and nuanced
                - clear land banking
                    - sit on land w/ assumption that surrounding properties will improve in value
                    - opposite of the author's proposal of land's value being judged on it's productivity
                        - unclear what extent this has played out...seems speculative
            - Sachin
                - The state's high modern view of community
                - Non-places
                    - transcient places where people are moving through but never stay
                    - Everybody is sort of upholding a contract w/ eachother

            - Venkat
                - since it's from 70s, ask: what extent have these ideas been realized?

                        - HOAs inside developer communities

                    - the more you are in a physical integrated environment, the more power the owner of the environment will have
                        - if elevator in high-rise goes out, homeowner is dependent on the government to fix the problem.

                - company town connection
                    - as you shrink the city scale, at what point does the fact of proprietary ownership make community aspect difficult?
                    - it's not the ownership structure that makes it hard or easy, but technology advancement
                - Bowling Alone
                    - in 60s and 70s, there were neighborhood bowling leagues.
                    - as community unraveled, leagues fell off
                - Tubes and funnels would really strengthen the proprietary community

                - Transcient communities have an easier time w/ social contracts. People on the move generally behave well, and when they don't you know they'll be going away soon. But permanent communities have lots of petty squabbles and long-running issues that require constant maintainence
                - The sharing economy is built on this premise. Airbnb was started to allow people to improve the productivity of their homes. Zipcar the same for vehicles.

            - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."
            - [[Frederic Laloux]]
        - {{[[DONE]]}} Â 1. Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas. https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30
        - 2. The path to success for a platform venture is by no means easy or guaranteed, nor is it completely different from that of companies with more-conventional business models. Why? Because, like all companies, platforms must ultimately perform better than their competitors. In addition, to survive long-term, platforms must also be politically and socially viable.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} **The read** is an article based on the excellent book The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, et al. is here:

        - {{[[DONE]]}}  3. Do you need a business ecosystem?
            - https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem
            - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing." 
It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.

        - 9. About Trust and Common Ground.
Given that lack of close connection and established trust, itâs also harder to develop the kind of common ground that facilitates productive interaction. The issues that people care about, the technical languages they speak, their modes of problem-solving, and their goals tend to diverge greatly when they work in different locations, specialize in different domains, and are responsible for different outcomes. Itâs particularly challenging to bridge the gaps in understanding if they donât know many people in common. The less employees know about each otherâs motives and knowledge bases, research shows, the less inclined they are to share knowledge with each other.Â This can lead to more mistakes, slower project completion, and, in many cases, less innovative outcomes.

1. https://corporate-rebels.com/morning-star/
2. https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers

Prompt:
- In an ideal world, how would you like to be interacting with the Yak Collective in two years?
- Are there any first principles you think we should be operating from?
- As far as the meta goes, what do you think our priorities should be? What are blockers?
        - {{[[DONE]]}} 13. A surprise read:
Today read may come as a little surprise. It is the most recent annual letter to shareholders, by Jeff Bezos.
https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
The prompt questions were:
            - How can we create value for people involved in The Yak Collective, potential clients, society at large?
            - Have we created something -- an idea, a process, a memorable phrase, a ritual, an artifact, ... , a bot, -- that can have lasting power, i.e. something that we will be able to refer to, say, 2, 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

            - Is it possible to create non-hierarchical social systems for humans? Power Distance. Lowest in Nordics, Israel and highest in Arab, Southeast Asian and Latin America. "Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modesÂ that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice." "  one context in which a structureless organization can work; a very small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds" "Medieval Iceland from theÂ [tenth to thirteenth centuries](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html)Â was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police. It lasted longer than US" "Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries" __Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?__ Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (âcommunication is only possible between equals.â)  One of the observations inÂ __Wealth of NationsÂ __is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we donât have a solution to the problem ofÂ __preventingÂ __them from emerging. __By defaultÂ __an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. **When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just âis this a system Iâd want to live under today?â but âhow effectiveÂ __will t__his system be in theÂ __futureÂ __at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?â**

__Weavers:__ I see the through-lines of connectivity between people, places, organizations, ideas, and movements.
__Experimenters:__ I innovate, pioneer, and invent. I take risks and course-correct as needed.
Frontline Responders: I address community crises by marshaling and organizing resources,
networks, and messages.
__Visionaries:__ I imagine and generate our boldest possibilities, hopes and dreams, and remind us of our direction.
__Builders:__ I develop, organize, and implement ideas, practices, people, and resources in service of a collective vision.
__Caregivers:__ I nurture and nourish the people around me by creating and sustaining a community of care, joy, and connection.
__Disruptors:__ I take uncomfortable and risky actions to shake up the status quo, to raise awareness, and to build power.
__Healers:__ I recognize and tend to the generational and current traumas caused by oppressive
systems, institutions, policies, and practices.
__Storytellers:__ I craft and share our community stories, cultures, experiences, histories, and
possibilities through art, music, media, and movement.
__Guides:__ I teach, counsel, and advise, using my gifts of well-earned discernment and wisdom
