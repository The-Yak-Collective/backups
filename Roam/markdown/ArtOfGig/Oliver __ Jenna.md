                - Ability to see and edit their own page
                - Ability to get included as part of our marketing
    - Serendipity engine: constrain the number of channels available for 'unassociated yaks' to interact with â†’ gated-channels should be focused and oriented to increase the salience and utility of roles 
    - Quests are naturally built in to the idea of gradually onboarding yourself into the relevant conversations where the relevant functionality gets unlocked
    - Flywheel effects are hopefully solved by creating a virtuous cycle of participation and recognition on behalf of the Yak Collective
    - Nothing as tacky as a points system but if it's the case we're marketing our own activity, it only makes sense to market the participants of that activity
    - The tangible position that is going to be developed is the production itself; it doesn't matter what we do as long as we're exercising the Yak brand by doing something interesting and of sufficiently high-quality
        - A production community you can hire
    - On the meta-list, everything will be covered by the forthcoming UX Journey diagram with exception the employee handbook and constitution/by-laws
