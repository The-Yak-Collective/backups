- Pre-read for today's online governance call: Our rudimentary starter page for governing client projects, based on precedents we are setting with the first one (neurofuturama) https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/nfdkLkuk1
- 
- ## Round-Robin:
- [[Chris R]]:
- [[Christian Bacher]]:
    - What about delivering a certain level of quality? Venkat responded: Feedback + feed forward, try the project method/product in an unpaid run before entering the paid space (examples: Don't waste the reboot --> Neurofuturama)
- [[David McDougall]]: 
    - [[David McDougall]]: Interesting to consider space between "Yak projects" and "personal projects"
    - Agrees that the client doc works as "principles" - and it is a virtue that it is not too codified and "rules-based"
    - a textual comment via Discord,in response to [[Grigori Milov]]: "@Grigori Milov (GMT+3) brings up a good point - the Yak branding has client-facing power in the sales/pitch process. How/when can we look for Yak projects (resourcing tbc) vs just bringing individual projects to Yak?"
- [[Drew Schorno]]:
    - Brief could be applied to non-paid projects as well.
- [[Greg Kramer]]: [Inaudible]
- [[Grigori Milov]]: 
    - Concern: "I have a client that's a little bit to big for me. I could use some help from the collective. I would be a little bit worried that individual contributors might target the same client.
    - "It's important to know, when I am talking to a client, that I know my role in talking to a client."
- [[John Grant]]:
    - Two points:
        - 1. Relating to the last clause, how dispute resolution would work. Protecting the reputation 
        - 2. Raising funds to create a legal entity for Yak Collective.
- [[Johnicholas Hines]]
    - Wondered if a "no-flake bond" would be useful – you put up money to be part of a team. If you deliver, you get your escrow back and project fee. If you flake, you forfeit to escrow to team.
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - To Gregory: you might build relationships one-on-one with YC members.
- [[Luke Butler]]
    - Mentioned article about "The future of work being distributed". __Will add here if Luke can source - Alex__
- [[Sachin Benny]]
    - "Yak coins" would be interesting.
- [[Scott Garlinger]]
    - Curious about how the experimental nature of the paid projects map onto YC governance. 
    - [[Suwaythan Nahaganeshan]]
- [[Thomas Verhagen]] - [inaudible]
- [[Vinay Débrou]]
- To me, a lot of conversation around YC official projects turn into conversations and sub-collabs.
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - **Some notes**
        - "A Yak Collective Compact"
    - Talking about responsibility to monitor for violations, and deciding what to do. "What does that decision look like? And how is that community?"
        - Is there a commitment to transparency? Is there a commitment to letting Yaks know about paid projects?
- How will governance towards Yak projects work from country-to-country?
- [[hershpat]]
- Only do subcontracts over national borders to mitigate counterparty risk of hiring international contracts.
    - "We try to make sure this doesn't happen."
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - YakC doesn't mitigate risks you don't already have as an indie consultant. What it does do is serve as an amplifier to connect and source back-end brainpower. __Paraphrasing here. - Alex__
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
- YC operating on a community-model/trust. 
- Going for implicit over explicit guidelines here.
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Possible 360-review process per project, report publicly available after project wraps.
- "How do we ensure a certain level of quality?"
- [[Christian Bacher]]
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - **Prefer "feed-forward" over feedback.**
    - We trial people and processes on unpaid projects. "We now trust it enough that we can use it on this Neurofuturama project."
    - Gatekeeping criteria for shipping
        - Project coordinators required to meet with two people who are not on the project. They qa the project thus far and decide whether to ship or not.
    - Bias against formal mechanisms. 
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - With regards to qa, ad hoc and more explicitly-declared teams informally green-light ideas and deliverables. Paraphrasing here
- [[David McDougall]]
    - Yak is equipped to do inbound, but "because we don't really exist, we currently cannot do outbound. Something to think about at a later date."
