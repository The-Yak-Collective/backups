- today we are brainstorming modular robot kits (whatever that means)
- step 1 intro
- step 2 (15 min) - each yak takes a subject from the following list and suggest between 3-5 alternative designs
- Step 3 (5 min) - each yak writes down 2-3 questions on the subject and that occurred to them while doing step 2
- Step 4 (5 min each) - each yak present their ideas and questions 
- Step 5 (10 min) pairing subjects. take one idea from each of two subjects and say how they work together. does in parallel, in writing
- Step 6 Summary and discuss linking a mission to some sort of parametrization
- subjects:
    - Data power bus
        - ideas
        - questions
    - Electrical connections
        - ideas
        - questions
    - Mechanical connection
        - ideas
        - questions
    - Diversity in parts vs alternatives
        - ideas
        - questions
    - Software modularity
        - ideas
        - questions
    - brain and internal organs (cpu, power supply, etc)
        - ideas
        - questions
    - Self configuration
        - ideas
        - questions
    - NOT: checking how things work, power load, coordination
