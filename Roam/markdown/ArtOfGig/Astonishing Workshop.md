                - The story involves the GCU __<True Name>__, a ship that, despite being old and experienced enough, has __not__ chosen a name for itself, and claims to be still searching for its first identity defining experience. It goes to a system with two inhabited planets, both around Level 5/6. One, Ukros is an older somewhat stagnant weaker planet with a rich history that was once the colony of the other one, Ruskos, a younger one with less history, which was originally settled by migrants from Ukros. Ukros is a somewhat anarchic Hobbesian federation of city states going through a dark age. It has islands of thriving science, enterprise, and culture, but also corruption, crime, and chaos. It is much weaker than Ruskos, but also dominates trade with the rest of the galaxy. Ruskos is an oppressive, authoritarian society is built around a state religion called Mimesiyah, based on the premise that most humans are base and corrupt, and that mimetic envy explains everything about them. In Mimesiyah the only hope is to let a rare Great Man individual known as the Imperior rule for life, above the law, and nearing his death, identify a 6-year-old child successor, based on holy signs of non-mimetic originality and greatness. A Straussian high priesthood actually governs day to day with a single stated objective to prevent what is regarded as the worst sin and sign of doom -- a scapegoating to kill the Imperior. The priesthood actually rules, and grooms the child successor to be a weak and compliant figurehead. Life revolves around the Imperior exhibiting an annual Mark of Originality, some sort of original creative work like a work of art or invention, in a ritual to legitimate continuation of the rule. The whole thing is completely captured, and anyone with actual originality is stomped out by the priesthood unless they escape to Ukros aboard a trade vessel. This constant escape of citizens to Ukros is a source of simmering tension, until Ruskos makes plans to invade and once more annex Ukros. 
                - At this point the Culture intervenes, sending GCU __<True Name>__, which sends an SC agent and drone to Ukros while the invasion is simmering. The invasion has begun, and is a few months in. The SC agent travels to Ruskos with a small band of Ukrosians she has assembled. Their goal is to trigger exactly the event Mimesiyah is built to fear -- a regime-ending scapegoating. This is to be done by undermining the Mark of Originality ritual, by producing incontrovertible evidence that the Mark is actually something the priesthood steals from some random actual original person, killing them and their family, with all provenance information suppressed. Except this time, the agent and the band manage to fake the whole thing, letting the priesthood think it has succeeded, when it has actually stolen an idea planted by the Culture. The day of the ritual, just a few hours before ritual, information about it is leaked. A popular insurrection begins, the military in Ukras mutinies, and a Ruskos mob descends on the palace to dethrone and kill the recently ascended child Imperior and dismantle the priesthood. This is now a moral quandary, and the SC agent, who was about to leave, goes back to try and save the child. But at the last minute, a drone sent by the GCU _<True Name>_ stops the agent, and allows the mob to take and kill the child, because it has reasoned that the Mimesiyah cannot be dethroned, nor Ukras saved, without actually sacrificing the child. Ruskos descends into a period of anarchic civil war, while Ukros shows signs of breaking out of its dark age, but unfortunately with a crime boss gaining power. The GCU _<True Name>_ delivers the SC agent to safety, and then kills itself, without ever naming itself. The rest of the Culture ships name it, post-mortem, the GCU __Object Lesson__
        - Take some technology that exists today and extrapolate it into what it would look/how it would function in the Culture universe of abundance and lack of meaning that the article talks about

                    - chaotic leverage wars
                        - a (happily) relatively undeveloped technology is the identification of leverage points in a society - those places where the application of a small amount of "energy" will have an outsized effect on the state of society. in the current state of development we can create a simplified model of society and, using a  computer simulation or perhaps solving a complex set of equations identify these leverage points, and press them. in movies, the CIA can maybe use this to cause a coup in a country or some social group can cause the us society to slowly change its views and behaviors.
                        - a common example in current sci-fi can be found in time travel, esp. as made popular by the TV show "legends of tomorrow". every time they step on a butterfly in the past,  future society is totally warped and they need to fix it. more important - there is often an evil genius in the background trying to make changes to the timeline and this evil genius must be fought over several episodes or even seasons.  
                        - given the evolution of computing power and sociological modeling, this process can be automated (i am thinking of a sci fi story where a kid finds a battle computer and uses it to fight economic warfare and save his family by cornering the market on olive oil or something) 
                        - so imagine that you have a large number of people/ AIs (lets say even only 100, but 1b is more likely) all simultaneously probing for weakness/leverage points in the Culture and applying energy in order to cause it to evolve in their idiosyncratic desired direction (trying to do so in a stealth manner until it is "too late").  they would be both competing and cooperating, with coalitions forming and breaking very often and, of course, be at odds with any institution or individual that benefits from the stability of the culture.   
        - Sachin's Premise 
            - {{word-count}}
                - Ivester is an underground artist who lives on one of the Culture Planets. Although he lives in the Culture he considers himself an anarch (In the Ernst Junger sense of the word). He makes the Culture’s version of music which is a more sensorial experience than 21st century music. The music is synced with the neural lace that audience wear and can be used sent signals  to the artificial glands that people have to secrete the right cocktail of drugs to elicit emotions that the creator wants. Controlling the neural lace of others without permission is considered taboo in the culture, so the concert goers go to Ivesters performance to seek the thrill of doing something taboo. The concerts themselves have the energy of an 80s suburban protestant church - austere and reactionary to the Culture's own abundance. Ivesters favorite acts are reworks of mediocre christian songs that he uses to elicit feelings of devotion that members of the Culture never experience. 
                - Ivester’s underground movement of reactionary artists have been gaining in traction. The Idiran war is about to begin and they see Ivestor as an ideal vessel to spread their ideology. The Culture is also aware of Ivestor and they establish contact with him. A special circumstances agent who is also a shapeshifter is sent to infiltrate the reactionary movement and become Investers muse. The shapeshifters goal is to change Ivester's ideological intentions to be aligned with that of the Culture by becoming the muse that Ivester has only previously experienced by simulating the brain waves of artists from earth that he admired - The Velvet Underground, John Lennon etc.

    - Reading: [What we lose when we lose literary magazines](https://countercraft.substack.com/p/what-we-lose-when-we-lose-literary?s=r)
    - Prompt: What does the future of literary magazines look like ?  any interesting examples would be nice
        - Venkat response
            - Honestly couldn’t care less about *literary* magazines. I get the function, and I liked a few McSweeney’s articles and used to contribute to our hostel’s lit magazine in college, but I doubt much is lost if they go away. Online + forums do well enough as a replacement. Perhaps better, since they eliminate the conceits of literary publishing.
            - But I’m very interested in the future of genre magazines, especially SF. I think a Renaissance might be possible — shared world building and lore, NFTs to monetize, rich online content like games and personality tests…
        - Sachin's response 
            - Emily Segals  projects on Mirror with $Novel look interesting, although right now it looks more like a crowdfunding project - https://emily.mirror.xyz/
            - AI assisted writing tools are interesting, and could be an interesting gimmick for a sci-fi magazine - figure out which parts were written by AI and which parts by a human - https://www.sudowrite.com/app 
            - NFTs of important artifacts/design fiction in a story could be interesting 
            - https://knots.live/ - another interesting Emily Segal project. 
            - Would be interested in learning more about how to build an audience for fiction
