                - The story involves the GCU __<True Name>__ is a ship that, despite being old and experienced enough, has __not__ chosen a name for itself, and claims to be still searching for its first identity defining experience. It goes to a system with two inhabited planets, both around Level 5/6. One, Ukros is an older somewhat stagnant weaker planet with a rich history that was once the colony of the other one, Ruskos, a younger one with less history, which was originally settled by migrants from Ukros. Ukros is a somewhat anarchic Hobbesian federation of city states going through a dark age. It has islands of thriving science, enterprise, and culture, but also corruption, crime, and chaos. It is much weaker than Ruskos, but also dominates trade with the rest of the galaxy. Ruskos is an oppressive, authoritarian society is built around a state religion called Mimesiyah, based on the premise that most humans are base and corrupt, and that mimetic envy explains everything about them. In Mimesiyah the only hope is to let a rare Great Man individual known as the Imperior rule for life, above the law, and nearing his death, identify a 6-year-old child successor, based on holy signs of non-mimetic originality and greatness. A Straussian high priesthood rules to prevent what is regarded as the worst sin and sign of doom -- a scapegoating to kill the Imperior. The priesthood actually rules, and grooms the child successor to be a weak and compliant figurehead. Life revolves around the Imperior exhibiting an annual Mark of Originality, some sort of original creative work like a work of art or invention, in a ritual to legitimate continuation of the rule. The whole thing is completely captured, and anyone with actual originality is stomped out by the priesthood unless they escape to Ukros aboard a trade vessel. This constant escape of citizens to Ukros is a source of simmering tension, until Ruskos makes plans to invade and once more annex Ukros. 
                - At this point the Culture intervenes, sending GCU __<True Name>__, which sends an SC agent and drone to Ukros while the invasion is simmering. The invasion has begun, and is a few months in. The SC agent travels to Ruskos with a small band of Ukrosians she has assembled. Their goal is to trigger exactly the event Mimesiyah is built to fear -- a regime-ending scapegoating. This is to be done by undermining the Mark of Originality ritual, by producing incontrovertible evidence that the Mark is actually something the priesthood steals from some random actual original person, killing them and their family, with all provenance information suppressed. Except this time, the agent and the band manage to fake the whole thing, letting the priesthood think it has succeeded, when it has actually stolen an idea planted by the Culture. The day of the ritual, just a few hours before ritual, information about it is leaked. A popular insurrection begins, the military in Ukras mutinies, and a Ruskos mob descends on the palace to dethrone and kill the recently ascended child Imperior and dismantle the priesthood. This is now a moral quandary, and the SC agent, who was about to leave, goes back to try and save the child. But at the last minute, a drone sent by the GCU _<True Name>_ stops the agent, and allows the mob to take and kill the child, because it has reasoned that the Mimesiyah cannot be dethroned, nor Ukras saved, without actually sacrificing the child. Ruskos descends into a period of anarchic civil war, while Ukros shows signs of breaking out of its dark age, but unfortunately with a crime boss gaining power. The GCU _<True Name>_ delivers the SC agent to safety, and then kills itself, without ever naming itself. The rest of the Culture ships name it, post-mortem, the GCU __Object Lesson__
        - Take some technology that exists today and extrapolate it into what it would look/how it would function in the Culture universe of abundance and lack of meaning that the article talks about
