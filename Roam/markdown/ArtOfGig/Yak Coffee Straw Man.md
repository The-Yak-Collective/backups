- This is: 
    - This is a YC __minimum viable gig,__ so it's a straw man. 
- The [[Marketing]] problem: 
    - How do we turn interest in Yak ideas into a consulting gig? A conversation.

- Assumptions to test
    - intake calls work with more than one person taking the call

    - Herds are a viable unit of organizing

    - free chats can lead to paid engagement
    - yaks want yakc to serve (in part) as a bizdev channel for folks who dislike or are newbies at or are bad at bizdev

    - yaks can discover trustworthy colleagues within our community
    - yaks will try for a platform comparable to fiverr (gig productization), patreon (subscription models), and a design portfolio service
    - inbound marketing can substitute for direct marketing and networking and word of mouth.
- A Yak Coffee is a 20 minute, free, virtual call between YC consultants with a stranger. 
    - potential client, the press, referrers, potential Yaks.
