- Notes from [[Jascha Wilcox]] special session on motors
    - or some some suggested skimming, I would like to share these mixed materials that focus on the topics of how motors work and how to select them. This is optional reading, so feel free to choose your own adventure
    - [General purpose 101 non-technical foundational skim](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one/all)
    - For an excellent and concise heavy technical foundation of how to mentally model motors, refer to sections 1-3, 5.1: [MIT open courseware link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-685-electric-machines-fall-2013/course-notes/MIT6_685F13_chapter1.pdf
)
    - For the industrial motion control selection mindset, [read all of the paragraphs and skip over the examples](https://www.kollmorgen.com/sites/default/files/public_downloads/Application_Sizing_Guide_en-US.pdf)
    - For the very broad hobbyist/non-academic selection mindset, check out [chapter 5 of this combat robot tutorial (suggest downloading the PDF):](https://www.riobotz.com/riobotz-combot-tutorial)
    - Also, if your interests lie more in the higher level considerations over nuts and bolts, [this is an excellent motors-related read](https://audioxpress.com/article/neodymium-the-perfect-storm-part-1-the-neodymium-supply-chain)
    - I should also mention that while it is extremely long, this is one of the best ground up document pertaining to motors if you have the patience. I would not suggest digging into it today, but instead use it as a reference to dig deeper. Reading chapter 1 and 2 will arm you with enough information to keep up with probably the top quartile of "motor people" [Motor deep dive link](https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/1507/JamesMevey2009.pdf;jsessionid=CB20BA044C9D8167E66602AD4B4E8B55?sequence=1)
