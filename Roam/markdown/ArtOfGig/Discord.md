# Purpose
    - Yak Collective comms & coordination.
    - Minimal participation bar:
        - Change server display name to given/chosen name
        - Add time zone to server display name (helps with coordination)
        - Post a short introduction to `introductions`
    - Users who don't meet the minimal participation bar after one week are pruned.
