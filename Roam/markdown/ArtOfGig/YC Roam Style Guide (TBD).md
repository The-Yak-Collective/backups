- # Basic Roam Concepts - YC style
    - ### Daily Notes
    - ### Blocks (bullet paragraphs)
        - You should already know that a "block" is the basic unit of content in Roam. Basically, each bullet point paragraph is a block.
        - Create a new block for each idea
            - make the block self contained as possible to make it easier to reference and embed.
                - like this: 
                    - Create a new block for each idea, or 
                    - You should already know that a "block" is the basic unit of content in Roam. Basically, each bullet point paragraph is a block.
    - ### Tags vs. Pages
        - in Roam (for now) there's no clear UX distinction of Tags and pages - each Tag becomes a page with references to that tag
        - So is important to clarify when and how we use them differently
        - {{[[table]]}}
            -  
                - **Page**
                    - **Tags**
            - **Objective**
                - Capture unique content (like a wiki/webpage)
                    - to label and reference a concept (e.g. positioning)
similar to other label/tag systems
            - **Includes**
                - Content
and Roam automatic references
                    - Roam automatic references
(optional) brief description of tag for disambiguation
(optional) link to related tags
            - **Formatting**
                - Capitalised words 
e.g. Yak Collective Collaborations
                    - lowercase
e.g. positioning
- ### How to comment/discuss
    - Roam is still not very friendly to track discussions and comments
    - before we get a way to hack notifications we use the tag ^^#ping^^ and the name of the person (page) -  "Let me know what you think [[Hugo Macedo]] #ping" 
        - each individual can check using either
            - a filter in his own page
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FA4wkLwLDhW.png?alt=media&token=ffc365bc-8c4b-44ce-a2ec-62bbc55e15c1)
            - use the query command in his own page - it avoids always setting the filter each time.

                - 
        - You can acknowledge the notification was read with ^^#pong^^ (this enables to filter out read notifications in your filters/queries)
- # Use cases best practices
    - Meeting minutes
        - One option is to include in daily note with #meeting-notes tag and associated page/tag #to-be-decided
            - {{[[slider]]}}
            - Pros: 
                - you don't have to search where does the project/cell files the minutes - they will be reference in the page and can be filtered or queried via `meeting-notes` tag
            - Cons:
                - makes daily notes with too much content
                    - you can "close" the block so only if you want you dive into the details
                - change current behaviour
                    - we can argue that there's no better time then now :) 
                    - we can tag previous meeting notes with `meeting-notes` tag to make it consistent

    - Cell Pages
