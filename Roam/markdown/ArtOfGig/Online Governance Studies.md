- Status:: {{or: Active | Early Concept | Proposal | Complete}}
- We meet every Friday on Discord Chat at 9 AM Pacific to read and discuss a short reading relevant to online governance. We have multiple reading tracks each with their queues, which you can find below. 
- For the 2021-22 season, we have 4 active tracks with active queues: Nature and Long-Term Thinking, Case Studies, Technology, and General. Please feel free to add links to any queue (preferred), or in the Discord ogs channel using the `$readingadd` command. The Discord list is used as an inbox/buffer and is periodically cleared and moved here.

    - [Governance in Review (GitcoinDAO Season 14)](https://pop.mirror.xyz/NbNlmtjw3hTzVHiCU9dBjcgFDxpD91UY8DOtl5Ht_x0)
        -    Matthew
            - Metaphors of seeing a DAO as biological organism
                - in OGS primer, failure modes
                    - do DAOs have tendency to overindex on particular images of organization? (ie organisms, machines)
            - interesting to see that even in progressive structure, they still end up circling back to solve typical organization problems (purpose, mission, vision, etc)
            - interesting that Gitcoin uses seasons to manage the cadence of governance
                - is this common in DAO space?
                - middleground between continuous integration and annual upgrades
                - drawn from new media (TV, video games, etc)
                - if someone comes in midseason, does that change the dynamic? or are the just means of delineating time.
        - Sachin
            - interesting, feels like they're reimplementing how medium-sized org work, but within a different medium
                - work needs to happen, so mission takes a back seat and you end up doing weird things with mission
            - YakC went through a cycle of this initially, trying to figure out a mission, but ended up finding it unfruitful
            - Meme: I just need to align on the goals of the organization
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FhP8KTIJkbe.png?alt=media&token=2a46b71a-b777-4844-8ba1-1dc2fbc84772)
            - having fun assigning level of goblin mode in various modes of his life
                - part of emerging org is being comfortable with things being in some level of goblin mode
            - stateless cities were easier to exist because everyone has same environment and shared sense of reality
                - how do you create stateless org when people don't recognize the same reality?
            - biology analogies idealize the Gaian emergent thing
                - not everything is emerging, some things are just collapsing
        - Venkat
            - gitcoin has good rep as an actual project for doing things
            - article is underwhelming relative to org's achievements (actually powerful mechanism)
            - quadratic mechanism has widespread gov application, very impressive compared to their governance modes
            - steward cards
                - means of counting who is actually involved in the project, necessary for this
            - voter matrix decision card
                - sort of like YakC decision channel
                - if we ever build a voting mechanism, we should have opinions attached...our prompt school can be adapted to this
            - you have to pay attention to things that seem elementary because inexperienced people might figure out weird new ways of doing things
            - algorithmic social scoring is a brand new idea, so there's lots of ground to be broken there...there are no adults in this space
            - echo Sachin's goblin mode...the world is in degenerative state but we still have to figure out how to maintain things
                - a lot of DAO culture is about figuring out when the energy and motivation are low
                - bots and templates and such are about making goblin mode better
        - Bryan
            - there is no such thing as equilibrium in nature...how would you even go about determining the ideal state? It's not like a machine, where man has built it and knows how it should be
            - Blood vessel analogy is poor because there are certain constraints we inherit from nature. 
            - Important distinction re:biology is the bits about transforming ecosystems and continual growth, not some ideal state
            - The stuff about habits is good, especially in goblin mode. What can be done to keep the ball in play? Yak collective is pretty good about this wrt meeting formats, consistency, automations, etc
            -  Participation, not engagement. Engagement feels dirty, like it's about marketing and ignores the fact that organizations should be two way, not one way. Participation should be the goal...are people showing up to hash things out, even if they aren't completely satisfied?
            - Being a Shepard/delegate that's responsible for success feels like it's getting into BDFL mode.
        - Venkat
            - once heard David Allen talk about GTD, researcher in Antartica, built around surviving in extreme environments, if things change there's immense stress. Goblin mode zombies have to do really heavy things in order to survive
                - what kind of workflow can survive not just inner degeneration, but outer degeneration?
                - The Checklist book (by surgeon...missed name). When surgeons are tired, they can't make mistakes, so they use checklists so they don't forget the basics, like washing hands
                - Yak C isn't hostile environment, but is a sort of refuge of burned out people. It's like the greeting sign at Ellis Island.
            - graph minds
                - inspired by Yak C in part
            - marketing isn't a thing you can or should do at DAOs (don't be about engagement)
                - opposite of start-up...it's a 'don't shut down' state of being
            - inviting people to join graph mind sounds like joining a cult, but people find their way into graph minds and discover something fruitful.
            - people stumble upon the boundaries of YakC and the automated processes work to put you in the proper place
            - like translating something and the immune system not rejecting
        - Sachin
            - co-CEOs
                - one person can be in goblin mode and another in high energy and they can switch modes to keep riding the wave
                - even in relationships...the adage that together you must add up to 100
        - Venkat
            - goblin portfolios...like a stock portfolio. multiple people can be in goblin mode within a good process and they can overcome goblin mode
            - sum greater than the parts at the bottom level of acceptable performance
                - weaknesses combined is less than a weakness
        - Matthew

    - [Atoms, Institutions, Blockchains](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0)
        - vgr twitter thread
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1550513962218795010?s=21&t=wt81ACVma5hrmwrExNOecQ
        - Grigori
            - False claims...unclear what the author is driving at
            - starts w/ definition of information came about in 1940s, but then went back to talk about information in 1800s
            - understand things about atoms, institutions, and blockchains, but doesn't see how the author is putting them together
        - Jenna
            - something interesting going on here
            - smart contracts are vulnerable to same things other social institutions/software is
            - non-state things on blockchain. new things will be created
        - Sachin
            - feels myopic...poor understanding of institutions but optimistic view of technology
            - interesting tangents
                - blockchain hardness...replace blockchain with any new technology and the same things can be said.
                - creating incentives w/ technology depends on creating some institution
                - atom hardness...reminds of nakatomi spaces.
                    - you can interpret a space in whatever way you want
                    - community sees it one way, but an intruder can interpret it differently
                        - something is only hard if someone chooses to interpret it differently than the majority
                        - basically what's going on w/ US Supreme Court and Clarence Thomas reinterpreting the institution
                - blockchain has already been institutionalized
                - blockchain is an instrument for techno capital to create power where they don't have power
        - Venkat
            - enjoyed the article...grasping at an intuition that's just beyond reach. makes sense why he's fumbling
            - author works for ethereal foundation
            - not sure this argument re:hardness for any technology is true. there are special things about blockchain that separate it from lithium bateries
            - schelling points...how do you coordinate without any basis for coordination? you basically have to guess or pick landmarks
                - this article is like Schelling points in time...infinite possible futures and limiting it to a more certain number.
            - blockchain code can be buggy too. BUT code that survives is code that gets managed over time
                - TCIP code is 50-60 years old, still has bugs, but it's everywhere and mostly just works for everyone
            - author's hunch is right...AIB is poking at things that the world hasn't figured it out
            - Striated and smooth, nakatomi work well here
                - moving in smooth space is more expensive than a striated one.
        - Bryan
            - Hardness vs. Antifragile
            - Random code on GitHub isn't very hard because in 20 years, you won't be able to pull it down and run it. the code might be valid, but it cannot be useful
        - Jenna
            - Do you need to be a prodigy to grok blockchain and other new technologies?
        - Venkat
            - lots of things have to be true for institutions to survive, and that's kinda the whole thing that this business of hardness is getting at. with blockchains, the same things are required, but blockchains seem to require fewer things to be true
            - Hardness by itself vs. reusable hard
                - old documents in lost language aren't reusable hard
            - measuring hardness of institutions: longevity/redundancy of core information assets (ie the Bible in Christianity)
        - Jenna
            - Gnosis has release Tabula (a mirror competitor)
        - Grigori
            - struggled w/ interplay between hardness and predictablility
                - has to do with information being fixed at a particular point in time, but that doesn't necessarily seem "hard"
                - Venkat: I think that's where the idea of cast comes into play
    - Chores
        - Readings
        - https://puzzling.org/politics-and-society/tech-community/2018/03/be-selfish-if-it-needs-to-be-done-someone-else-can-do-it/
        - https://www.bmc.com/blogs/keeping-the-lights-on-ktlo/
        - Prompt: Identify some tensions between innovation and maintenance, and provide some attributes which we could model a 2x2 for orgs of all types
        - Venkat
            - KTLO has haters
                - research people complain that budgets are eaten up by KTLO
                - firefighting eats up budgets too
                - KTLO as a category is a good thing
                    - means you've got a machine that works and needs attention to keep it working
                    - KTLO = value
            - presence of high KTLO costs means people might not be thinking critically
                - as time goes on, costs should go down because you get better at maintaining
                - "evolutionary end state of commodity design"
            - tension: does KTLO exist because people aren't pushing cost curve down enough? or is it a constrained by inertia?
                - minimal vs bloated KTLO cost as an axis
        - Gender focus on chores
            - chores as pillar of society is a character trait, gender agnostic
            - Die Hard w/ a vengeance
                - cop that does the thing because he's in the place at that time
                - Cop is a backstopping kind of job, just needs to do what needs to be done
            - KTLO as essentialist way vs characteristic perspective
            - 2x2: is it really KTLO or subjectively KTLO?
                - sometimes when people stop doing things nothing happens
                - Yak Coll welcome squad...we tried, stopped, muddling though now but it's absence doesn't kill a thing.
        - Sachin
            - Be Selfish
                - small org, people need to take on chores or other tasks that aren't enjoyable or stimulating
                - regardless of gender, people need to take these things on
                - there are things that people think can be ignored and things will be OK
                    - is it good enough to keep the ball in play?
                    - you don't need to be extensive/details to ship
                    - sometimes you get lucky when you do things like this
                - sometimes people think you need to work more to ship more, but you can ship less by doing what's only essential
                - a lot of things don't matter at a certain scale
            - KTLO
                - depends on the org...tenured ones spend more on KTLO
                - some KTLO work is can just be automated but hasn't, and people have been churning the same tasks for too long. Seems miserable for everyone.
                - some orgs do things w/out a core competency for innovation's sake
                    - they don't get the implication of new thing on existing thing
                - Chesterson's Fence
                    - if you don't know why something exists don't change it
                - Joel Spolsky on launching a product: don't completely rebuild a product and launch a slightly different version of it
        - Jenna
            - - ktlo is often misidentified, maintenance is uncool eg Why I am Not a Maker piece by Deb Chachra
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/
- 2x2... 1 axis needed/notneeded, other axis:  __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ _?
- what actually moves the needle
- work smarter not harder ie wu wei (not really, prolly)
- yc reading list maintenance
- event set up in discord
- yaktweeting events
- prompt school set up
- knack set up
- heat map+newsletter
- welcome new yaks
- rewarming existing yaks
- what is minimum viable community management
- gender divide, prolly
- another piece on "glue work" relevant
        - Grigori
            - mistake to think that innovation and KTLO are opposites
            - sometimes people just want to present the dichotomy to make a point
            - innovation is perceived as sexier than maintenance
            - value of maintenance and value of innovation isn't clearly defined
            - if you know the value of something, then you can use appropriate incentives to get those things done
            - power game dynamic over budgets, resources, etc
            - 2x2
                - innovation
        - Bryan
            - sometimes chores by themselves can be worthwhile
                - in a spiritual sense, like the rebuilding of the temple at Ice Jingu
                - good for introducing people to a particular set of skills
                    - by eliminating chores, do we prevent people from fully developing their skills
            - There's a budget/time/resources aspect
                - big budgets get you fancy KTLO solutions
                - no budgets require cobbled together solutions that just work OK
            - Doing things for the sake of doing them (enjoyable, even if not essential) is OK if you have the resources
                - it's like the high production value Lorecraft at companies. It's over the top but they have the cash to fund those endeavors
            - Backstoppers vs Explorers
                - organizations need both types. too great of an imbalance can lead to status games between maintenance and innovation
        - Jenna
            - nobody really pushes things forward at Yak Collective
            - none of the existing members have the energy...do we need to find people that have the energy?
        - Venkat
            - many things are necessary in a long-term way
                - vitamins (long-term) vs aspirin (short-term)
                - if you continuously do unhealthy things you will destroy yourself
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FozOrTyxpGs.46.45%402x.png?alt=media&token=75286581-e77d-4f0a-bb43-4becb0352166)
                - Ise Jingu is a giant vitamin
                    - lots of things become determistically necessary when you hold a particular meaning frame
        - Sachin
            - don't see a lot of vitamin-unecessary quadrant existing today
                - corporations have lots of churn in terms of people, so they don't feel like it's necessary to do the long-term vitamin style work
        - Jenna
            - often, KTLO is the wrong word
                - if something needs to happen and needs to be automated, just do it
                - if it can't be automated, then it's maintenance, and don't disparage it with KTLO term
        - Grigori
            - people that actually exercise enjoy it
            - people who don't, usually find it boring
            - apply to maintenance, if you do it the right way, you won't complain about it
            - Bryan: reminds me of backstopping
        - Venkat
            - to Jenna's point about innovation in YC being driven by Venkat
                - you have to constantly be doing little experiments, you just have to realize that most things will fail, and even if it succeeds, you don't have to exercise that option
            - at portfolio level, experiments 
            - if you're committed to continues exploration, that commitment is a KTLO activity
                - if you have a budget and 80% is devoted to maintenance (deterministic KTLO) the rest of the budget should be diversified across experiments
            - "goblin mode for too long will kill you"
            - "I think steadily doing experiments, trying new things, and doubling down on a fraction, is a vitamin at the level of individual experiments but aspirin at the level of the portfolio. It doesn't matter if this or that experiment fails or succeeds but is not doubled-down on as an option, but some yield fraction of experiments must succeed, and some further fraction of that must be doubled down on to renew/grow the org and replace what is lost through obsoloscence/entropy/decay. So at that meta level, "innovation" is a KTLO"
    - The Networked State
        - Reading item and prompts
            - Saw a lot of links that hovered around the creation of new cities, so thought this would be fun.
                - Read a summary of Balaji's The Networked State (https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words%29
                - Describe initial reactions to the idea and any related thoughts. Any strong ideas you like? Anything you, uh, don't?
                - Alternative if you're familiar with the book concept: read Vitalik's review of the above: https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/07/13/networkstates.html
                - Bonus: consider the dashboard of Networked States (https://thenetworkstate.com/dashboard%29 and propose your own (hint: think of one moral differentiator that you could use to organise and grow a decentralised community around)
        - Thoughts and comments
            - Notes
                - Anuraj in listen mode
                - Grigori
                    - Might be difficult to transition from centralised states to decentralised states now?
                    - Talks about failure modes: the nation state's ability to impede network connectivity and slow connection to decentralised communities
                    - How can an individual at a low level trust that there's no commitment or negotiation between nation states and decentralised communities/networked states?
                        - What are the failure modes?
                - Jenna
                    - Doesn't match up with being disconnected via geography, as opposed to malicious disconnection/blocking
                    - The feeling of reality when being connected vs being disconnected is qualitatively different
                        - How does this work when transitioning between on and offline?
                - Matthew
                    - General
                        - Aware that there's a lot of hype around the release, so picked it up as an intermediate read while I was away
                    - Like
                        - Opens the door for questions about the mechanics of nations, states, nation states to a much wider audience and revokes some of the taboo status associated with them
                            - Kinda like cryptocurrency allowed the questioning of the nature of money and the proposal of alternatives
                        - Makes the point that belonging to an imagined community should be opt-in
                            - Not a consequence of chance (who your parents happen to be, where you happen to be born and when)
                            - My own story, Stateless, about coming of age meaning a choice of nation states

                            - Typical nation states use vague caricatures of nation-ness, appeals to authority or history to invoke commitment and alignment

                    - Dislike

                        - Overlooks a lot of the practicalities—and much of the dirty work of governance—at the nation state level (e.g. infrastructure, social care)
                        - Not everyone is a very online person (majority excluded, which constrains success)

                    - My own networked state?
                        - Most of the existing examples are positive—van life, nature-connected or OldEuro-vibe cities, digital nomads
                        - I'd like to see something in service of negatively impacted individuals, packs, tribes, imagined communities—political dissidents, maybe investigative journalists, halfway homes for refugees or migrants

                    - Televangelists (and the modern church?) as an existing example of the networked state

                        - Why is it proposed as a new idea?
                - VGR
                    - A little bit averse because quite close to it
                    - The vision is mostly wrong, but in an interesting way
                    - The way to interpret is to see the origins of the person proposing it
                    - Reproducing the "main character" energy problem
                        - People only used to high agency propose solutions dependent on high agency
                    - Has a longer history: began with an innocuous Balaji talk at Stanford about Silicon Valley disengaging and exiting
                    - High agency, high power in tech; in larger arena (like media) found himself with voice problems and involved in conflict
                    - Can't solve problems about a certain scope with engineering and innovation only, no matter how powerful, rich etc. the main characters are
                    - Summary why he's wrong: his origin story is a bet on a wrong axiom—everything cannot be solved by exiting and building an alternative
                        - At some point other actors/parties/stakeholders have to be acknowledged and worked with (or, worse case, war and conflict)
                        - At a certain scale, voice starts to outcompete exit
                    - Worth considering as a mind-expanding exercise, despite the apparent issues with the exit bias, reductionism etc.
    - [Why Do We Obey Rules?](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/why-do-we-obey-rules)
        - Grigori
            - distinction between rules and models
                - in the past they were the same, but models have evolved over time
            - thin rules v. thick rules is helpful
                - if rules are thick and require interpretation they can't be bent in particular ways
        - Jenna
            - title of New Yorker review
                - it's not why we obey, but when
                    - important to break rules
                    - military disregarding unjust orders
            - are there local things for breaking rules, or are the criteria for breaking rules absolutist
            - if you're a bureaucrat and meet a citizen, the citizen should be able to expect to be treated the same as every other citizen
            - schmidt quote: "definition of sovereignty is getting to decide on exceptions"
            - "radius of predictability"
                - improving that is all we can ask for
            - good abbott = BDFL
        - Matthew
            - if we were to ask what the rules of YakC are, what are they? how could they be categorized (thick vs thin)?
            - are thick or thin rules more compatible with lean or fat systems?
                - what happens when combining the different options?
            - strongly implied that rules lag behind culture and norms
                - if that's the case, why are rules established at all?
            - rules are optional that's downstream of culture, not an immutable fact of the universe
            - interesting asymmetry: takes magnitudes more effort to unmake a rule than to harshly enforce the rule
        - Sachin
            - why do some rules last longer?
                - seems like it's because they're based on interpretations.
                - thick rules have stronger believers
            - rule formation
                - a lot of conflict arise when thin rules are applied broadly in order to make things legible and easy to manage.
                - thick rules that turn into thick rules...a lot of hot button issues today are like this
            - radius of predictability
                - on day to day, it's bad because rules are based on other rules who are based on other rules. hard to really know what's going on
                - even if you figure out a rule, sometimes you miss a detail or there's someone else using a different rule so it's tough to know what's going on

            - trad philosophers are stuck in their own heads
                - philosophy is the art of making maps of experienced reality
            - lean v fat, thick v thin
                - trying to think about how thickness sheds light on modeling vs rules aspect of reality
                    - rule saying all houses must be painted red
                        - if you want to question the rule, you might nerd snipe w/ color theory, introduce ambiguity, etc
                        - if that rule is interpreted as thin rule, it will have some reference or basis
                        - models are scientific, rules are political
                            - rules can have exceptions, given by dictator-type
            - the anarch and monarch are sovereign by today's standards, but previously sovereignty was only given to the absolute ruler
            - rule of law v rule by law
                - china makes up rules and applies them, and rulers there are above the law, they are rule by law
            - what's the role of the monarch?
                - declaring the nature of reality
        - Bryan
            - Rules help legitimize a state or give a ruler sovereignty, but individuals also benefit from the certainty that rules introduce.
                - rules of thumb, heuristics help people make decisions
                - also brings stability, because people can make maps of the world and use them over and over.
            - What happens when people break rules?
                - both religion and state judicial systems recognize this and provide space for people to make amends.
                - giving that space probably helps citizens buy into the regime. If they didn't have it, they'd be more likely to attempt a takeover
            - Rules for unmaking
                - why would you have rules at all then?

    - [The Legacy of Hammurabi](https://law.mit.edu/pub/thelegacyofhammurabi)
        - Grigori
            - comparing rules and models from last week
                - rule is cut off version of a model
                    - we know that we need models, but instead we have rules, which are simplified versions of models.
                    - rules say what to do, not to do
                    - rules make assumptions of inputs and outcomes, wioth a model that describes how in translates to out
                - why is this so?
                    - rules are tools for social programming. todays reading references this
                    - simple structure allows most people to avoid the details of inputs and outomes
                    - don't think, just follow the rules
            - following the rules
                - two types of people
                    - rule followers and rule composers
                    - important to not leave out this detail
            - somebody has to write the algorithms, and they aren't the same people who are subject to the rules, makes space for movement
        - Bryan
            - no mention of blockchain or smart contracts was interesting
            - Is there space for lawlessness in all of this? Not necessarily in a malicious way, but in a new frontier kind of way
            - there will always be people who don't want to interface with rules in the moment.
                - guy sees flower, guy picks flower because he likes it, whether or not he knows what it is or whether its legal to posess
            - excessive regulations - how long do people play along before the scope of automated reg is to omuch of a burden
                - how much is too much?
        - Sachin
            - read a story about a doctor's algorithm for determining whether someone is receiving to many opioids.
                - woman had dogs (dependents) receiving prescriptions under her name, so she was flagged as an abuser instead of an honest user
            - recidivism algorithms for figuring out who likely an inmate is to commit another crime, used to decide lengths of sentence, bail price, etc
                - supposed to remove bias from legal system, but just introduces bias from whoever wrote the algorithm
            - computational law makes law easier to manage the complexity
                - "I did it because the algorithm said so"
            - encapsulated vs sysmetic complexity
                - laws have more systemic complexity than is visible on the surface
                - something with encapsulated complexity better candidates for algorithms
            - decisions are already made with these systems
                - in the future, maybe its more about understanding how to play around with the algorithm, instead of understanding how the law works
            - Robin Hood of the legal algorithms could be a thing
        - Venkat
            - author is aware of blockchain but chose not to cover. possibly because comp law is a separate field with extended history
            - valuable for blockchain people to look at this
            - to grigori's point of "who wrote the laws"
                - in developed authoritarian states, law is written to be illegible to average citizen, so they can never be in compliance
                - legal systems as a whole are written with this hostile intent in mind.
                - powerful governing authorities need to leverage against you at their discretion
                - most of the time it won't be used against you
                - US is example of this when it comes to small biz law
                    - so much compliance, licensing, regulations, etc
                    - not because a single dictator wanted rules, but instead it's bottom up
                        - barbers wanting to introduce barriers to entry via legislation
                - laws against self-repair
                - as comp law grows, understanding these issues is critical
                - worst case scenario: cabal of lawyers write self-driving car laws creating loopholes for automatic lawsuits
                - MOre power = more law distortion
            - delegated behaviors
                - smart house thermostate is delegated to control HVAC
                - could be following laws from different jurisdiction, you could be breaking a law in you locality
            - ada palmer series
                - she constructs nation-less world
                - hives have hive laws
                - people choose to be hive-less
                    - they get to choose between 3 sets of default law
                        - white law: altruistic
                        - gray law: reasonable law
                        - black law: minimal, basically an outlaw
                - Hives can set their own laws
                - we are probably headed in this direction
            - connection to APIs, cloud, SaaS systems
                - law encoded as distant cloud-based reality
                - defined how API allows you to interact with it

            - rules as group hypnosis moment
                - enough people must buy in for an rules to work
            - police need to used discretion to enforce law, but is that anything other than the road to ruin?
            - "complexity is the enemy of understanding"
            - john rockefeller
                - didn't break any laws to build his empire, but they made a lot of laws because of it
            - is there any way to not end up with more complexity than humans can handle?
            - let's automate everything that can be automated for you
                - always unexpected edge cases and side effects, how can we create processes to handle exceptions
            - pubpub is a tool to explore
        - Grigori
            - another failure model
                - when legal system is underdeveloped, there is a lot to fix
                - parliament just keeps making laws and nobody has the attention span to keep up with the changes
            - difference between physical space and metaverse is huge, they need dramatically different legal systems
        - Venkat
            - if things go wrong for you, and it's obviously wrong, the right to due process is an interesting fundamental
                - indian constitution, right to constitutional remedy, one of the only rights that cannot be suspended in any emergency
                - Karl Popper meant this in Open Societies book
                    - premise: there are no absolute truths
                - in an open society, there are no absolute laws, but can be resolved by a law saying you're always entitled to legal change
        - Jenna
            - books on founding of boston
                - guys got charter from king of england, but nothing said it had to be in england, because england never had to deal with foreign lands

            - JD: Make good rules, not too many
        - Venkat
            - that's evolution at work
            - silicon valley's whole thing is figuring out ways to work around the law in ways that nobody found before
            - code base grows more and more
                - over time, knowledge grows, so legal code must accomodate
            - you lose control if laws are automated, it's not necessarily bad
            - absolute amount of agency could grow when ceding some agency in legal realm

            - uncap, how property rights come into play
            - Sarah Perry, Frontierland piece
                - lore of the frontier is different from how it was originally defined by Frederick Turner

            - if it wasn't so wild, what was?
                - something european, what were the murder rates in London in a given year during the same time period.
            - keeping track of crime is a function of the state. no state, no records.

            - question: how do we properly shepard culture so that it evolves at an appropriate pace?
        - Grigori
            - Culture not coded properly
                -  rules and taboos don’t contain sufficient information
            - to transmit culture
                - you need a leader, someone who is trusted
                - you don’t want to ignore directions
            - in culture, most causes and effects are very unclear
                - effects can come back a long time after the cause
                - Culture needs top down AND bottom up
        - Jenna
            - the joy of a detailed book review for efficiency
            - imitation: surprised mirror neurons didn't come up.

            - ongoing question
            - collaboration v cooperation v competition

            - Chesterton's fence
                - don't get rid of things until you know why they exist
                - applies to a lot of modern systems
                    - when you join a new company, you have so many questions about why things are
                    - first instinct is abandon those things or evolve them
                    - but those things could be embedded in fabric of org
            - need authority, need to see other people doing the same thing
            - He came to US on regular permanent visa, which few people go through the trouble of doing, but he knew lots of people who'd already done it, so it felt reasonable for him to do

        - Venkat
            - why and how cultural evolution transmission would've changed in the last century
                - the three mechanisms
                    - old people, experts, people like you
                    - speed of change has happened so fast that it's intragenerational instead of intergenerational. you can't learn from yourself 20 years ago. those behaviors are no longer adaptive
            - self-consciously imitate someone younger
                - cache invalidation
                - learned behaviors can be dropped, new ones can be picked up
            - people like you have the same problems as you
                - we all live in isolated villages
                - but we've all moved to environments that are completely different from villages
                - your life can be dependent on non-local things (like chinese supply chains)
                - causal pattern behind of adaptiveness of seeking diversity
                - the definition of who is like you has shifted
                    - no longer demographic-based, but lifestyle or abilities-based
                - editor's note: this is the whole basis for the yak collective
            - expertise in the sense of smart, educated, credentialed people doesn't make sense
                - expertise in cultural aspect is learning from a long history of humans
                - reversion to older patterns
                    - credentialed, downloaded education + patched has shifted to a system more like looking around you and seeing who's plugged themselves into modern traditions
                    - he's a blogger, and knows the whole ecosystem well, but it's all unconscious and basically useless. it's hard to teach too
                - expertise is being immersed in the right place in time
            - review feels like an overcompensation for the Rationalist ethos
            - everything has accelerated, which means basis for cultural evolution has shifted
                - you can't afford to let evolution become unconscious
                - ask how exactly is evolution going on?
                    - what's hangover?

                - Hannah Arendt-ish
                - Analysis is solid but not strongly original

            - Spiritually in Ivan Illich Convivial lines of thinking
                - not convinced that acceleration is bad, including socially
                - intergenerational things might not be good
                - acceleration is stressful
                    - can be managed though
                    - no effective response
            - Catastrophic ways out might be the only way to stop acceleration
        - Sachin
            - you become more unhappy looking for a solution to accelerationism
            - https://jonathanrexallen.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/hegels-unhappy-consciousness/
            - frenetic standstill is academic term for goblin mode
            - lots of these ideas are like Twitter memes
            - Discomfort around uncertainty
                - in the west, everything was predictable, but has changed in the last decade
                - must be a way to become more comfortable with uncertainty
                - doing things proactively instead of under bad circumstance
            - venkat's thread about looking to your own past for guidance on how to act in the present

                - advice is often useless 
        - Matthew
            - prefers the term "motion" over acceleration
                - feels more neutral
                - acceleration assumes forward motion, progression
            - Thomas (Nail?)
                - goes through history and slices it into eras
                    - cetripedal motion - coming in

            - liquid modernity, flow-like concept
            - alienation in modern culture
                - rate of change experienced by individual vs group
                - cultures are changing faster than the individual can?
                - or have individual and culture been decoupled and moving at different rates?
            - stamping out acceleration altogether, vs. stepping away from acceleration and hold on for dear life.
            - redistribute motion between individual and group
            - we're exposed to lots of information, does that effect how we experience the rate of change?

                - "The bad news is you’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there’s no ground."
            - useful to have early adopters and laggards
                - always makes sure we push things forward while having survivors
            - some people deal with rug pulls better than others
            - "life is one rug pull after another. it gets easier the sooner you learn to make peace with that"
            - fluid in your conception of work and life, accepting change
        - Grigori
            - acceleration is not necessarily bad
                - it's neither good or bad, actually
                - going to happen whether you like it or not
            - communist manifesto says basically the same thing as this reading
            - it's just more comfortable to live in a stable environment, but it's not a given
            - success is legible, we can see when people are doing big, important things
            - what can we do?
                - condition ourselves to be more comfortable w/ acceleration
                - OR become a force of acceleration and carry forward other people with us.
                - focus more on doing things that are actively new.
                - don't reduce any motion to something null
        - Dave
            - governance is critical to managing acceleration
            - push and pull technologies help with the governance

        - Bryan
            - What are we accelerating towards?
                - likes Matthew's framing of motion instead
                - reminded of Danes vs. Saxons, where Saxons were obviously technologically superior, and everyone knew it
                    - also: printing press, internet, other innovations where there was hyperacceleration
            - Lots of focus on the tools and systems enabling accelerations, not much on the actual people/groups pushing on the accelerator
                - Gutenberg vs. Luther, who made the bigger impact?
            - Could continous motion (without visible forward progress) be the antidote to acceleration?
                - Ise Jingu, Bangladeshi Charlands
                    - people who habitually rebuilding their environments, so they're always doing something, but never really going anywhere.

        - **Impact Networks**
            - sachin
                - network leadership model isn’t surprising
                    - modern companies work in this hub-and-spoke manner
                        - are they decentralized?
                - you don’t hear a lot about amazon’s executive team
                    - clones of Jeff Bezos, with similar framework of thought
                    - they’re network leaders
                - decentralized orgs are different
                    - instead of everyone alignment, if you have network leaders that are loosely aligned but pursuing their own things, that’s a good model for decentralization
                - avoiding authoritative decision making, critical hubs
                    - feels unavoidable regardless of whether network is centralized or decentralized
                    - there are people that, if removed from network, the network falls apart
                    - something cannot emerge from nothing
                - a lot of writing in this space casts hierarchy as a problem
            - Grigori
                - this is pretty obvious by now, yet we don’t do it the way the author describes
                    - applies to a lot of network orgs
                    - easy to read, hard to implement
                - no evidence that hub and spoke to network org is even possible, no examples
                - strong pull in hierarchical structure
                    - if you are top or center of hub, there are a lot of personal risks in ceding authority
                    - multi-hub
                        - every person here feels the same way…not wanting to give up authority
                - There are good hierarchies that do things right
                - if you are undecided between hierarchy and network, nothing good happens
                - amazon isn’t a multihued, it’s a well-functioning hierarchy
            - Dave
                - agree w/ grigori about easy pull to hierarchy
                - always a power curves, someone is always much much better than everyone else
                - written to people who are just going over the basics
            - Bryan
                - it’s not hierarchy vs network, it’s both
                    - hierarchy naturally happens, it should be embraced, and those with authority would be wise to be good network leaders
                - the question is, how do you create strong networks? it seems like a lot of networks are very weak, and therefore not all that useful
                - without hierarchy, you end up with lots of peer-to-peer competition for status, which distracts from the objectives.
                    - having managers creates more of a cooperative-competitive environment
            - Jenna
                - getting booster, impressed by CVS organization
                - agree that there’s nothing new
                - who’s his audience
                    - lots of young people joining DAOs, this is new for them
                    - in that case, this is a nice writeup
                - how do we behave?
                    - doesn’t cover this point
                    - we’re always status seeking, how do you work around this simple biological fact

                - commanding things and them happening
        - Matthew
            - do each of the philosophies tend to prioritize the immutability of different parts of the contingency trio?
            - if you assume that one part of the trio (ie people) is a fixed variable, you get a nice platform to experiment with the other two.
                - systematically investigate how things can be tinkered with
            - constant emphasis on meaning and narrative
                - philosophy of work inevitably degenerates into the same types of debate as philosophy of life
            - continuously surprised by the narrative component of work
        - Sachin
            - wanted to hear more about how much coordination is required
                - scientists needed less coordination, so they communicated less, so the reduced structure works for them
                - Stockton group in the study had low coordination headwinds
            - Bezos: more communication indicates dysfunction
            - working in an office vs remote
                - being present together builds trust, rapport, etc in informal ways
                - remote work tends to be very formal, structured communication
            - coordination headwinds on start-ups
                - as you grow you need more structure and more communication
            - time horizons
                - shorter term "sprints" vs longer term narratives and roadmaps in future quarters
        - Venkat
            - when people give an "it depends" answer, it means that people haven't thought much about the problem
                - but occasionally that answer means the author understands the depth behind the topic
            - article represents good solid research in org theory
                - n=1 experience has low confidence, but this kind of article takes those individual intuitions and solidifies them w/ research
            - had experience in his phd with an advisor that had strong top-down managerial tendencies
            - 2nd advisor was also top-down as a backstop tendency until the student proves that they can drive themselves
            - wrote a bunch of articles as he was learning about management in mid 2000s
                - managed small team in a startup-y environment that was in a larger org
                - a manager needs to understand the type x or y tendencies of their employees and tailor managerial approach accordingly
            - instincts about managing
                - huge part is empathy and attunement, it can be harder to have empathy with people who are demographically and psychographically different than the manager.
            - worked with odesk (upwork) to work on task management tools
                - "hirer managing", big brothers management, very theory X

            - individual motivation
                - there's a lot more to satisfaction than competence
                    - really a blend of things: the work itself, autonomy, achievement, people, purpose, etc
                - Maslow wrote a theory Z after this was published, talking more about self-actualization
                - People can be type Y, but inside a type X organization
                    - they can cross the boundary as they get worn down by top-down management
                    - crossing into type Y is possible, but requires lots of work and probably different organization
            - innovation in organization
                - been reading Drucker's Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
                    - talks about the necessity of separating innovation from typical operations
                        - innovation is type Y, operation is type x
                - Organization cannot be divorced from function. 
                    - they work together to create ideal working environments

                    - product team was hands off approach
                    - rest of org needed lots of top-down, even those who weren't even his subordinates
                - lots of communication between an individual team and the rest of the org
                - people find ways to become immune to top-down management
        - Jenna
            - an entrepreneur is someone who can get other people to do things for them

                - how do they get leveraged by different types of people
                - difference between someone with low agency and high agency
                    - if you're low agency, how would you put some of the principles for sustainable hypercomplexity into use?
                    - high agency people are in the position to fuck around and find out
                - principles have an inherent kindness
                - tina ideologies seem to be harsh and uncompromising

            - tweaking the system at an axiomiatic level seems analogous to Muddling Through
            - Tech world in last couple of decades was dominated by TINA ideologies

            - In 90s FF was popular, but in 00s he started to decline, now it's surging again
            - These 2 volumes fall into the point in time where FF was wrestling with "the history of the end of history"
            - VGR might've been more confident that it was true
            - To Shreeda
                - rule of law is a book full of laws
                - accountability is the mechanism for holding leaders to some standards
                - FF makes subtle distinction
                    - rule of law v rule by law
                        - by law, rules exist, there are certain people who are above the law
                        - of law, rules are strong, and no leader is strong enough to be above them
            - FF deprecated Greek history of democracy and inherited ideas from the high middle ages
                - ancient greece is bad example
                - between 900-1300 AD in europe is good one

- Summary of readings 21-22
    - Bryan 
        - Cory Doctrow disney article - lore - governance ideas
        - idea mazes (future reading), Zapatistas article and Northern Syria article 
        - long arc of governance, you have to survive before you have something to govern. 
    - Grigori
        - Dillemmas in general theory of planning - it can be used as a springboard to learn about the future of planning and what they are thinking of planning right now. 
        - would be good to read about planning and what that looks like in the current world 
    - Jenna
        - wishlist: spaced repetition bot to resurface articles and notes that we have to keep them current in our headspace 
        - future reading on non grifty parts of the DAO space and review of those 
            - eg https://www.dorg.tech/ | https://blog.dorg.tech/ | https://docs.dorg.tech/workflows/doing-internal-work#the-swarm
    - Matthew 
        - readings - slide deck about co-ordination headwinds, rock paper scissors (bio reading)
        - potential future track - fundamental governance constraints - extrapolating from the above readings
        - is there an equivalent for modern/complex governance views 
    - Sachin 
        - ise jingu - refer to it a lot in terms of maintenance, and adapting to new conditions, and also applies in terms of preserving process knowledge
        - messi  - feels like how yc operates and to an extend how people in the yc operate on an individual level also fall somewhere on that spectrum
        - future topics
        - prompt school
        - anything else that I've been thinking about - prehistory of some of the ideas we have been discussing, early 20th century -
    - Venkat 
        - Ise Jingu - renewal and long termism being the same problem. Normally you think about it in terms of something for 10K years, Ise Jingu uses the idea of being regenerative. 
        - nobody is doing that type of thinking. corporations think in 3-5 year terms, no one thinks in the 20-30 year terms
        - "wood decays but the idea does not"
        - Rock paper scissors - Hobbesian and Gaian felt very simplistic and perhaps naive, rock paper scissors. what are some non cartoon ways of thinking about evolution 
        - blockchain readings back to this track 
        - historical case studies vs theoretical and conceptual evolution. what are conceptual leaps or technological leaps that create new governance ideas

        - I[ntroduction for Culture shifters](https://vbsd.super.site/introduction-for-culture-shifters)
            - Sachin
                - articulate signals are external if you want to attract external people - projects themselves have articulate goals 
                - and if the project is not able to articulate it then it kind of fails 
                - the metaphors seem interchangeable - funnels and tubes - something can be both a tube and a funnel. Or tubes can accelerate funnels or create new types of funnels 
                - Slower tubes - encourage a different type of activity 
            - Grigori
                - does not apply to all types of scaling 
                - YakC feels like monoculture 
            - Venkat 
                - Cities dont have strong goals and scaling creates optionality
                - During scaling for companies the optionality goes down 
                - Developing an aversion to funnels altogether 
            - Bryan
                - We are good at tubes, we are bad at funnels 
                - People join - how do we direct people towards things that they want 
                - "Ships passing in the night" 
                - Turning tubes into spaces generally fail and probably not a good heuristic 
                - common bias of the last 15-20 years towards illegibility and not legibility. Can metrics be done in a smarter way? 
        - [encapsulated vs systemic complexity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html)
            - when does encapsulated become system - sometimes it happens when the problem is punted down 
            - encapsulated vs systemic - product decisions, the choice seems to be between encapsulated vs systemic complexity. computer vision example 
            - when do microservices run into issue - when there is interaction - and I think there is distrust that is created in a system encapsulated 
            - distrust of encapsulated 
            - systemic complexity - could be caused by heroic actions
            - cities - encapuslate 
            - interactions between subsystems causes enca
            - worrying about encapsulated complexity - time and capital demands, affected by other factors - reason DAOs or we havent run into the problem 
            - Brian 
                - similar to monolithic software vs microservices. monoliths have more co-ordination issues. 
                - lack of local knowledge causes systemic complexity
            - Venkat 
                - complicated vs complex
                - economy is complex - fuzzy boundary
                - jet engine - complicated - clearly defined interfaces
                - optimization -> convex function defined on a complex set 
                - complicated systems are optimizable because their boundaries are defined 
                - if you do complicated systems with fixed boundaries, you are creating time bombs 
                - the perfectionists - book on airbus engine?
                - conways law - product structure will mimic conweys law - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law
            - Grigori
                - if its a two person team, all the complexity is encapsulated 
                - when does it become systemic 
            - Vijay
                - your mental model did not incorporate all possible changes (the interface changes)
            - Kiran
            - Kartik (from chat)
                - Complicated vs complex reminds me of https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy
                - Looking through a deployment lens:
                    - The success of microservices is entirely due to deployment 
concerns. Microservices lean into Conway's Law by allowing teams to deploy on independent schedules. The interfaces aren't necessarily better in microservices, but by existing they turn into Schelling Points. People start to rely on them, and so the people who maintain them start to care about not breaking them.
                    - Vitalik says we should tend to try to encapsulate complexity, but that grants a lot of political power to the people who can make changes inside the encapsulation boundary.
        - [Biodiversity may thrive through games of rock paper scissors](https://www.quantamagazine.org/biodiversity-may-thrive-through-games-of-rock-paper-scissors-20200305/) 
            - 
                - What they have found is that over time, rock-paper-scissors may enable many species to coexist in the same area by cycling in and out of dominance.
                - reminded me of the clueless coming to power in organizations that are extremely large - iron law of bureacracy - In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely.
                - Kropotkin mutual aid - written around the same time as Darwin
                - In a DAO is there any direct competition? or how would it work in the case of a DAO - may be it cycles through to autonomous organization when no one is around 
                - and if survival is not an issue what happens - civilization style governance? just based on memes and culture wars? 
                - impact of local environment 
                - If species A starts to go extinct, she explained, species B might evolve in such a way that A can recover. This idea also works in reverse.
                - “A species doesn’t always have to be the best. It just has to have enough times where it can be sufficiently good that it can weather the bad years,” - muddling through
                - species does not go exist because of just local environment changing 
                - how does it apply to humans?jobs and governance - more power on the side of the individual?
                - what about emergent phenomenon with more conscious intent ?
                - Bryan
                    - cycling of powers reminded of professional sports teams and how they cycle through good phases and bad phases
                - Grigori
                    - Similar rock paper scissors dynamics in management. For example company with three equally powerful founders is not stable. somebody has to run it even if it has three owners. Starts with someone volunteering without explicit competition. another dominant players comes in when the first one makes a big mistake. since the other two have untouched reputation, they see themselves as a stable system. goes on until everyone is a sore loser. at this point competition sets in because of this dynamic. 
                - Kartik
                    - connection: red queen theory. genetically uniform populations are susceptible to parasites. sexual reproduction makes populations more biodiverse within a single species
                    - connection: fermi paradox - we tend to focus on the idea that ["technology implies belligerence"](http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-21-07-09-03-soc) but biodiversity may be responsible for a more optimistic universe 
                    - connection: [core wars](https://gamasutra.com/view/news/22822/Analysis_Corewar__The_Ultimate_Video_Game.php) is designed for 3 kinds of strategies: replicator/scanner/bomber. What does a game/governance model designed for 4 strategies look like?
                - Kiran
                    - viewed mental model of a system as hiearchial with chaos induced. 
                - Venkat
                    - CRIPSR - you can make dna modifications to produce aritificial insulin but it reverts back to its original state, not a stable evolutionary strategy. 
                    - arrows theorem?impossibility of selecting the right candidate in a democratic election 
                    - survival of the stupidest - if they a co-operate in a smarter way could win over the smarter person
                    - lot of interesting phenomenon that happens when we go from two to three
                    - de-desertifying soil is really hard. roots of grass have complex ecosystem specific to a terrain. chances of success are low if its not adopted to a particular area 
                    - other examples 
                - Matthew
                    - Main thing I noticed is that biodiversity/ecosystems science/thinking starts from a point of dynamism and motion, which turns out to be way more robust than other disciplines which start from stasis and stillness. The other thing I was wondering related to the Primer archetypes. Is there a rock-paper-scissors mechanic between them (e.g. does Gaia beat Muddler?), and are there longer-range cycles of dominance involving the archetypes (e.g. does Citadel dominate in wartime, Gaia in times of prosperity)?

The other thing, based on Venkat's mention of instability, reminds me of something related to John Boyd. Deliberately engineered instability gave F15/16 its agility; can unstable ecosystems be deliberately created for certain situations?

            - 
                - Sachin
                    - it seems there already is shared language, culture and metaphors which helped Zapatista do this
                    - the contrast of zapatista vs neoliberalism is pretty interesting. wonder if land reform would have worked in India if neoliberalism worked  
                    - its hobbessian in some way cause global capitalism is the bear
                - Bryan
                    - very difficult for such organization to gain a hold on broader culture
                    - tyranny of structurelessness thing where they went from organizing to being violent 
                    - need a physical reminder that you are working on something 
                - Commits
                    - online orgs have a singular focus on a topic or action. but not beyond that? 
                    - no immediate fallout of collective energy because they are developing relationships with each other 
                    - what would by default globalism that is publicly visible look like? 
                - Grigori
                    - people felt hopeless then they declared war again "global capitalism"
                    - its not enough to get power you have to hold onto the power - and that requires different set of skills
                - Jenna
                - Kiran
                    - US constituition vs Zapatista. lot of pre-work is done but not really

                - Venkat
                    - Narmada valley movement 
                    - social movements start with a specific goal (vs NAFTA/vs WTO/vs Narmada Dam) but then they switch to having vague goals such as against global capitalism
                    - to an extend you can say they have succeeded cause they are still alive 
                    - LEIF coalition - goal is to pay Brazil to not cut down the amazon
                    - Last mile distribution of climate incentives is a moonshot level problem. people's behaviors will remain the same 
        - [Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria)
            - another interesting read would be about the catalms
            - The [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty) was abolished. Prisons house mostly people charged with terrorist activity related to [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL) and other extremist groups, and are a large strain on the region's [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Rojava).
            - makes me think about how in poorer countries you kind of stick with the family and friends you have, cause it is in some ways process knowledge
            - most of their ideas have emerged from their own context and not from an external context
            - effect of the french mandate -  led to formation of these regions?
            - makes me think of axis powers and allies as level one chains and the rest of the countries, including third block are kind of like level 2. Where would DAOs be? Level 3 or 4.
            - third block
            - "For a former diplomat like me, I found it confusing: I kept looking for a hierarchy, the singular leader, or signs of a government line, when, in fact, there was none; there were just groups. There was none of that stifling obedience to the party, or the obsequious deference to the "big man"—a form of government all too evident just across the borders, in Turkey to the north, and the Kurdish regional government of Iraq to the south. The confident assertiveness of young people was striking. - seems kind of hobbesian
            - The main sources of revenue for the autonomous region have been presented as: 1. Public properties such as grain silos and oil and gas in the Jazira Region, 2. Local taxation and customs fees taken at the border crossings, 3. Service delivery, 4. Remittances from Iraq and Turkey, and 5. Local donation
            - Grigori
                - you can get centralized as much as you want, but if you have a hostile neighbor then the centralized system kind of falls apart
                - hostile enemy can crush you at any moment.
                - if you want to make a jump to a more powerful system you need centralization of some kind

                - energy levels of different projects - impressive that we meet every friday. got over the hurdle of having something worth spending time on. On the flip side, having the energy to get the paper done which is a high energy mode is harder.

            - Matthew
                - leaving an artefact/time capsule of your experience

                - Having incentives aligned is needed for something like an "open" approach work
                - tension in the article between doing something vs realizing what is uncontrollable. how big of factor this is is unclear

            - Venkat 
                - this one is written by a low agency rank and file person, who are not as constrained. First instinct was to be slightly bored by it.

                - 2X2. agency vs constraint. 
                - whats unique about github - the pull request 
                - YC - there is literally no way to make somebody do something

                - analyzed whats going on and arrived at cliches? 
                - we have to be careful with what we can learn from our experience, so that we dont arrive at the cliches. We should not fit the narrative of the cliche. 
        - Messi thread 
            - Sachin
                - Messi's style of play has to be complimented with a specific strategy that works for messi. which means other players have to sort of sacrifice or play a different role 
                - Also when messi works - seems like he does the work of 2-3 brilliant players at the same time. 
                - longer he goes in his career - has the charismatic effect - more defenders engage him which leads to srendipity for other players in other parts of the pitch and zemblanity for the opposition 
                - In most organizations there is a need to justify everything you do - exploratory periods are fewer - actual mistakes or things leading to dead ends are not admitted 
                - Messi was sick as a child and had lactic acid build up fast
                - Alexander technique/non judgemental awarness is curative
            - Grigori

                - wu-wei 
                - adapting around other players strength - more possible in soccer than other games - how much is it a function of the looseness of the rules 
                - modern war is more like soccer and older war is more like american football 
                - working around energy patterns. - similar to wind in the willows. instead of starting with a goal, start with what you are capable.

            - Sachin
                - “will post my comments since I likely won’t stay on for the call. I find such trad takes personally amusing since I grew up in a town that was full of small shops and stores that rapidly urbanized and gave way to fancier stores/restaurants, and everyone was really excited about it. I think that’s the primary difference I’ve noticed between the west and the developing world. Growing up in India, you had fewer resources and money but the tempo/mood of the narrative was clearly upward , you could see things changing around you and people were mostly excited for it. While after I moved to the US, I’ve access to more resources and money but it feels like I came in at the end of something and people are nostalgic for something”

                - Work being out of view
                    - almost at the beginning of the end of the impact of the Internet revolution
                    - the primary way we interact w/ computers is a mouse, but the possibility of interaction is near infinite

                    - (added book to reading list, I missed the title)
                    - Literature is written with a “history can be forgotten” attitude
                    - Ideas are ahistorical

                            - Street food culture
                                - it’s mostly uninnovative…vendors copy and there’s nothing new for decades
                            - new things have high failure rate
                                - this holds people back
                        - Are there areas in the world good at this?
                - The internet as museum
                    - humans live short time
                    - living memory is short
                    - small scale things get forgotten quickly
                    - important to preserve informal memories
                    - the internet expires content. domains expire. dead people and organizations stop paying to keep artifacts alive. curators reframe and rewrite history. 
                - Sarris has balance of restorative nostalgia and reflective nostalgia
                - Venkat skeptical of people who are poetically nostalgic. “Soft demagoguery”

                    - Idea mazes
                    - Can we do idea mazes in the regular world?
                    - What’s the idea maze of New York street food?
                        - to do it, you’d need to 	know the history of NY street food
                - Meredith
                    - idea mazes aren’t something people actively do…seems like people just absorb them
                - Venkat
                    - half dozen founders that are idea mazes
                    - Conor from Roam did this
                    - if you don’t absorb idea maze, chances of success are low
                - Matt
                    - “On idea mazes: there’s like a barren middle ground? You either know the space (in the present and historically) organically, or you’ve got no effing clue and project such a strong reality distortion field that unknowledge doesn’t matter. The middle ground (e.g. someone mechanically identifying an opportunity and trying to go to market)”
                - Bryan
                    - Lore and idea maze are connected
        - [Jesuits ](https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/jesuit/)
            - Bryan
                - trust in the jesuit system is high, didnt need to be watched. They trusted that other jesuits were doing the same thing as they were doing. 
                - what would not talking to peers look like in the internet world?  What does changing the frequency of activity mean?
                - Jesuits were good at PR - printing press
                - instance of path dependence - would the jesuits have existed in a place without the other infrastructure that existed around them? right people at the right place in the right time
                - bias on observing/orienting vs not acting 
            - Grigori
                - they had ambitious goals, because it clashed with traditional order they found ways to hide it 
                - The development of the school was very fast for the time in which it was developed 
                - they were very strict most of the time. 
                - the system that made them spread very fast seems unclear. Interested to know more about what happened initially 
                - they used printing press, but it does not follow from the article that competing movements did not use it?
            - Jenna
                - the letters when they arrived - how are the documents controlled, distributed, who decided what to print. internal decision making is unclear 
                - async model - has a lot of writing/documenting involved. would be interesting to see if it comes out as product output in some way 
            - Matthew 
                - first time reading about jesuits was - novel about jesuits??
                - they were providing legibility as a service - emphasis on translating documents, interfacing between different regions, describing what they were seeing. And thats what sucked a lot of people in 
                - royal patronage helped them to get to the boundaries of the empire or liminal spaces between them. wonder how being associated with the state changed it. what is akin to royal patronage that jesuits had?
                - tendency to document --> similar to everything being async by default. 
            - Venkat 
                - went to a jesuit school
                - couple of things that didnt come through -  in the period of printing press -> westaphalia, jesuits were late adopters to this. Pamphlet wars 
                - they became advisers for ...
                - jesuits were good at getting close to the rulers and becoming the consultant equivalents of the time. They were more about political influence rather than religious
                - jesuits - do most of things in the ears of rulers and not talk directly as much publicly 
                - reason they were travellers - complimenting the printing press - preventing the info from getting in the hands of others 
                - they had access to capital 
                - had a lot of local autonomy but not decentralized. big capital played a big role in projects 
                - reasons async communications worked - most of it was about money. Important things went through central authority 
                - they did a lot of predictive processing - send out advisory blog posts 
                - yak school operating more in that mode than we realize. letter writing was much more commmon and frequent. 6 mail deliveries a day. increased in tempo 
                - people spend hours reading and responding to letters
                - adapting to the medium.if there are long time delays you keep communicating hoping that some of it is useful. 
                - lot of military operations have to unfold in radio silence. same strategy. high level autonomy for local commanders. commanders set overall goal, local commanders have smaller goals and they have contracted agreements between them.  similar to how the jesuits do it. overall mission was clear - spread the religions. filling in the details would be not predictable exactly 
        - Commons 
            - Sachin
                - does not seem like it applies to platforms, unsure if it applies to web3
                - does it even apply in terms of governance of cities and such
                - it also seems away from the commons - the way we operate 
                - local circumstances rules apply 
            - Grigori 
                - it does not describe what we have here, it would benefit us if we could compile something along the lines of 8 principles 
                - none of these really apply to yak collective 
            - Bryan
                - probably not much theres something extremely negative that someone can do to harm the common resources we have
                - we have the option of easily leaving 
                - renegotiate when something comes up 
            - Venkat 
                - Elinor Ostrom - nobel winning economist, is at the socialist side of things
                - Amartya Sen 
                - probably all 8 should be spectrums 
                - applying it to public internet - large models scrape the entire internet - but it fails in that too
                - it does not mean that public internet is not good commons 
            - Jenna
                - good guidelines for things that we want to do if conflict comes up 
                - assume good actors vs assume bad actors (Lunar punk??). in cases where there are bad actors - its not tragedy of commons but different problem 
                - https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720/982314638056251412 - commons example?
        - [Bulldozer vs Vetocracy ](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html)
            - having a fixed limit for processes that are put in place - such as the shrine of ise jingu example. The limit should perhaps be more than or exactly one generation perhaps. so that it avoids sociopathic incentives to a certain extent 
            - cases where the vetocratic mechanism is used to stifle something that could actually be more useful with a bulldozer 
            - recognizing when to be vetocratic vs when to be bulldozer is hard - requires
            - Venkat 
                - Fukuyama - vetocracy - anything can be blocked at 6 levels. Effectively the way things get sorted out is people go to the courts and get things settled there. 
                - individual european countries are not like but other governance structures took ideas from this 
                - baramdipity?? there is serendipity but there is an external force that is trying to change to to zemblanity environment 
                - bulldozer thinking - its pretty old, vetocracy is a newer idea. 
                - yak collective bull dozer bias -- DAOs generally have vetocracy bias - DAOs have a knob from bulldozer to vetocracy. system 
                - code management - people went from thinking of code as something that they own to something that is more open/communal, until 5-6 years, the onboarding process for new employees - on the first day you were supposed to push something into production 
                - go from individual vetocracy to collective bulldozer (anyone can change anything), if you are not competent, you may destroy something 
            - Grigori
                - "we have a pretty huge bulldozer in our country" that is fighting against vetocracy
                - it is a 30,000 foot view on whats going in DAO or society, it can be abstracted down to lower layers as well 
                - current state of yc - much more important to find more bulldozers and not to distract by trying to regulate - finding the bulldozers itself is not easy
            - Jenna
                - making a distinction between what regime would I want to live under vs where I myself am a regime or making the regime
                - adjectives - bulldozery vs vetocractic

                - Old book with a different context.
                - A lot has changed, the author's version of community is different from what an antropologist's would be.
                - Not what a community is, but what a community can do?
                    - what are the use cases of a community?

            - Matthew
                - mixed-use urban development meme "it's all good"
                - Conception of community as a nested stack that feeds on one and other
                    - internet as stack w/ layers
                        - app layer isn't fixed, constantly moving target
                            - community is the same way. changes as we become more sophisticated and nuanced
                - clear land banking
                    - sit on land w/ assumption that surrounding properties will improve in value
                    - opposite of the author's proposal of land's value being judged on it's productivity
                        - unclear what extent this has played out...seems speculative
            - Sachin

                - company towns might be the ultimate form of proprietary community. They're also dependent on technology to exist
            - Venkat
                - since it's from 70s, ask: what extent have these ideas been realized?
                    - this is actually the default
                        - HOAs inside developer communities
                        - Puppet government
                            - homeowners get to govern, but administration is in hands of developer
                        - condos and apartments are even more extreme example
                    - the more you are in a physical integrated environment, the more power the owner of the environment will have
                        - if elevator in high-rise goes out, homeowner is dependent on the government to fix the problem.
                    - the more complex communities have all the amentities that you need. not a company town, but has serendipidous environment

                - company town connection
                    - as you shrink the city scale, at what point does the fact of proprietary ownership make community aspect difficult?
                    - it's not the ownership structure that makes it hard or easy, but technology advancement
                - Bowling Alone
                    - in 60s and 70s, there were neighborhood bowling leagues.

            - Bryan
                - Libertarians always simplify these things. A hotel exists in some larger municipality, and is dependent on others for utilities and has to manage relations with neighbors.
                - Transcient communities have an easier time w/ social contracts. People on the move generally behave well, and when they don't you know they'll be going away soon. But permanent communities have lots of petty squabbles and long-running issues that require constant maintainence
                - The sharing economy is built on this premise. Airbnb was started to allow people to improve the productivity of their homes. Zipcar the same for vehicles.

                        - about special economic zones around ports and places where people are trying to attract foreign investment (the other end of the spectrum...multinational and geopolitically convenient)
                        - Like airports where people are committed to being there for a longer term
            - Grigori
                - uniformity of the cities is a function of how cities are and also how travelers see them

            - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."
            - [[Frederic Laloux]]
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  1. Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas. https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30
        - 2. The path to success for a platform venture is by no means easy or guaranteed, nor is it completely different from that of companies with more-conventional business models. Why? Because, like all companies, platforms must ultimately perform better than their competitors. In addition, to survive long-term, platforms must also be politically and socially viable.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} **The read** is an article based on the excellent book The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, et al. is here:
                - https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-future-of-platforms/
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  3. Do you need a business ecosystem?
            - https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem
            - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing." 
It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.

        - 9. About Trust and Common Ground.
Given that lack of close connection and established trust, it’s also harder to develop the kind of common ground that facilitates productive interaction. The issues that people care about, the technical languages they speak, their modes of problem-solving, and their goals tend to diverge greatly when they work in different locations, specialize in different domains, and are responsible for different outcomes. It’s particularly challenging to bridge the gaps in understanding if they don’t know many people in common. The less employees know about each other’s motives and knowledge bases, research shows, the less inclined they are to share knowledge with each other. This can lead to more mistakes, slower project completion, and, in many cases, less innovative outcomes.

1. https://corporate-rebels.com/morning-star/
2. https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers

Prompt:
- In an ideal world, how would you like to be interacting with the Yak Collective in two years?
- Are there any first principles you think we should be operating from?
- As far as the meta goes, what do you think our priorities should be? What are blockers?
        - {{[[DONE]]}} 13. A surprise read:
Today read may come as a little surprise. It is the most recent annual letter to shareholders, by Jeff Bezos.
https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
The prompt questions were:
            - How can we create value for people involved in The Yak Collective, potential clients, society at large?
            - Have we created something -- an idea, a process, a memorable phrase, a ritual, an artifact, ... , a bot, -- that can have lasting power, i.e. something that we will be able to refer to, say, 2, 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

            - Is it possible to create non-hierarchical social systems for humans? Power Distance. Lowest in Nordics, Israel and highest in Arab, Southeast Asian and Latin America. "Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modes that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice." "  one context in which a structureless organization can work; a very small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds" "Medieval Iceland from the [tenth to thirteenth centuries](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html) was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police. It lasted longer than US" "Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries" __Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?__ Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (“communication is only possible between equals.”)  One of the observations in __Wealth of Nations __is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we don’t have a solution to the problem of __preventing __them from emerging. __By default __an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. **When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just “is this a system I’d want to live under today?” but “how effective __will t__his system be in the __future __at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?”**
