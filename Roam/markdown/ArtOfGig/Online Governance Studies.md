- We meet every Friday on Discord Chat at 9 AM Pacific to read and discuss a short reading relevant to online governance. We have multiple reading tracks each with their queues, which you can find below. 
- For the 2021-22 season, we have 4 active tracks with active queues: Nature and Long-Term Thinking, Case Studies, Technology, and General. Please feel free to add links to any queue (preferred), or in the Discord ogs channel using the `$readingadd` command. The Discord list is used as an inbox/buffer and is periodically cleared and moved here.

        - [Wikipedia on Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)
        - [Ise Jingu and the Pyramid of Enabling Technologies](https://theprepared.org/features-feed/ise-jingu-and-the-pyramid-of-enabling-technologies)
        - I[ntroduction for Culture shifters](https://vbsd.super.site/introduction-for-culture-shifters)
            - Sachin
                - articulate signals are external if you want to attract external people - projects themselves have articulate goals 
                - and if the project is not able to articulate it then it kind of fails 
                - the metaphors seem interchangeable - funnels and tubes - something can be both a tube and a funnel. Or tubes can accelerate funnels or create new types of funnels 
                - Slower tubes - encourage a different type of activity 
            - Grigori
                - does not apply to all types of scaling 
                - YakC feels like monoculture 
            - Venkat 
                - Cities dont have strong goals and scaling creates optionality
                - During scaling for companies the optionality goes down 
                - Developing an aversion to funnels altogether 
            - Bryan
                - We are good at tubes, we are bad at funnels 
                - People join - how do we direct people towards things that they want 
                - "Ships passing in the night" 
                - Turning tubes into spaces generally fail and probably not a good heuristic 
                - common bias of the last 15-20 years towards illegibility and not legibility. Can metrics be done in a smarter way? 
        - [encapsulated vs systemic complexity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/02/28/complexity.html)
            - when does encapsulated become system - sometimes it happens when the problem is punted down 
            - encapsulated vs systemic - product decisions, the choice seems to be between encapsulated vs systemic complexity. computer vision example 
            - when do microservices run into issue - when there is interaction - and I think there is distrust that is created in a system encapsulated 
            - distrust of encapsulated 
            - systemic complexity - could be caused by heroic actions
            - cities - encapuslate 
            - interactions between subsystems causes enca
            - worrying about encapsulated complexity - time and capital demands, affected by other factors - reason DAOs or we havent run into the problem 
            - Brian 
                - similar to monolithic software vs microservices. monoliths have more co-ordination issues. 
                - lack of local knowledge causes systemic complexity
            - Venkat 
                - complicated vs complex
                - economy is complex - fuzzy boundary
                - jet engine - complicated - clearly defined interfaces
                - optimization -> convex function defined on a complex set 
                - complicated systems are optimizable because their boundaries are defined 
                - if you do complicated systems with fixed boundaries, you are creating time bombs 
                - the perfectionists - book on airbus engine?
                - conways law - product structure will mimic conweys law - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law
            - Grigori
                - if its a two person team, all the complexity is encapsulated 
                - when does it become systemic 
            - Vijay
                - your mental model did not incorporate all possible changes (the interface changes)
            - Kiran
            - Kartik (from chat)
                - Complicated vs complex reminds me of https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy
                - Looking through a deployment lens:
                    - The success of microservices is entirely due to deployment 
concerns. Microservices lean into Conway's Law by allowing teams to deploy on independent schedules. The interfaces aren't necessarily better in microservices, but by existing they turn into Schelling Points. People start to rely on them, and so the people who maintain them start to care about not breaking them.
                    - Vitalik says we should tend to try to encapsulate complexity, but that grants a lot of political power to the people who can make changes inside the encapsulation boundary.
        - [Biodiversity may thrive through games of rock paper scissors](https://www.quantamagazine.org/biodiversity-may-thrive-through-games-of-rock-paper-scissors-20200305/) 
            - 
                - What they have found is that over time, rock-paper-scissors may enable many species to coexist in the same area by cycling in and out of dominance.
                - reminded me of the clueless coming to power in organizations that are extremely large - iron law of bureacracy - In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely.
                - Kropotkin mutual aid - written around the same time as Darwin
                - In a DAO is there any direct competition? or how would it work in the case of a DAO - may be it cycles through to autonomous organization when no one is around 
                - and if survival is not an issue what happens - civilization style governance? just based on memes and culture wars? 
                - impact of local environment 
                - If species A starts to go extinct, she explained, species B might evolve in such a way that A can recover. This idea also works in reverse.
                - “A species doesn’t always have to be the best. It just has to have enough times where it can be sufficiently good that it can weather the bad years,” - muddling through
                - species does not go exist because of just local environment changing 
                - how does it apply to humans?jobs and governance - more power on the side of the individual?
                - what about emergent phenomenon with more conscious intent ?
                - Bryan
                    - cycling of powers reminded of professional sports teams and how they cycle through good phases and bad phases
                - Grigori
                    - Similar rock paper scissors dynamics in management. For example company with three equally powerful founders is not stable. somebody has to run it even if it has three owners. Starts with someone volunteering without explicit competition. another dominant players comes in when the first one makes a big mistake. since the other two have untouched reputation, they see themselves as a stable system. goes on until everyone is a sore loser. at this point competition sets in because of this dynamic. 
                - Kartik
                    - connection: red queen theory. genetically uniform populations are susceptible to parasites. sexual reproduction makes populations more biodiverse within a single species
                    - connection: fermi paradox - we tend to focus on the idea that ["technology implies belligerence"](http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-21-07-09-03-soc) but biodiversity may be responsible for a more optimistic universe 
                    - connection: [core wars](https://gamasutra.com/view/news/22822/Analysis_Corewar__The_Ultimate_Video_Game.php) is designed for 3 kinds of strategies: replicator/scanner/bomber. What does a game/governance model designed for 4 strategies look like?
                - Kiran
                    - viewed mental model of a system as hiearchial with chaos induced. 
                - Venkat
                    - CRIPSR - you can make dna modifications to produce aritificial insulin but it reverts back to its original state, not a stable evolutionary strategy. 
                    - arrows theorem?impossibility of selecting the right candidate in a democratic election 
                    - survival of the stupidest - if they a co-operate in a smarter way could win over the smarter person
                    - lot of interesting phenomenon that happens when we go from two to three
                    - de-desertifying soil is really hard. roots of grass have complex ecosystem specific to a terrain. chances of success are low if its not adopted to a particular area 
                    - other examples 
                - Matthew
                    - Main thing I noticed is that biodiversity/ecosystems science/thinking starts from a point of dynamism and motion, which turns out to be way more robust than other disciplines which start from stasis and stillness. The other thing I was wondering related to the Primer archetypes. Is there a rock-paper-scissors mechanic between them (e.g. does Gaia beat Muddler?), and are there longer-range cycles of dominance involving the archetypes (e.g. does Citadel dominate in wartime, Gaia in times of prosperity)?

The other thing, based on Venkat's mention of instability, reminds me of something related to John Boyd. Deliberately engineered instability gave F15/16 its agility; can unstable ecosystems be deliberately created for certain situations?

        - [A Spark of Hope: The Ongoing Lessons of the Zapatista Revolution 25 Years On](https://nacla.org/news/2019/01/18/spark-hope-ongoing-lessons-zapatista-revolution-25-years)
            - 
                - Sachin
                    - it seems there already is shared language, culture and metaphors which helped Zapatista do this
                    - the contrast of zapatista vs neoliberalism is pretty interesting. wonder if land reform would have worked in India if neoliberalism worked  
                    - its hobbessian in some way cause global capitalism is the bear
                - Bryan
                    - very difficult for such organization to gain a hold on broader culture
                    - tyranny of structurelessness thing where they went from organizing to being violent 
                    - need a physical reminder that you are working on something 
                - Commits
                    - online orgs have a singular focus on a topic or action. but not beyond that? 
                    - no immediate fallout of collective energy because they are developing relationships with each other 
                    - what would by default globalism that is publicly visible look like? 
                - Grigori
                    - people felt hopeless then they declared war again "global capitalism"
                    - its not enough to get power you have to hold onto the power - and that requires different set of skills
                - Jenna
                - Kiran
                    - US constituition vs Zapatista. lot of pre-work is done but not really 
                - Scott
                - Venkat
                    - Narmada valley movement 
                    - social movements start with a specific goal (vs NAFTA/vs WTO/vs Narmada Dam) but then they switch to having vague goals such as against global capitalism
                    - to an extend you can say they have succeeded cause they are still alive 
                    - LEIF coalition - goal is to pay Brazil to not cut down the amazon
                    - Last mile distribution of climate incentives is a moonshot level problem. people's behaviors will remain the same 
        - [Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria)
            - another interesting read would be about the catalms
            - The [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty) was abolished. Prisons house mostly people charged with terrorist activity related to [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL) and other extremist groups, and are a large strain on the region's [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Rojava).
            - makes me think about how in poorer countries you kind of stick with the family and friends you have, cause it is in some ways process knowledge
            - most of their ideas have emerged from their own context and not from an external context
            - effect of the french mandate -  led to formation of these regions?
            - makes me think of axis powers and allies as level one chains and the rest of the countries, including third block are kind of like level 2. Where would DAOs be? Level 3 or 4.
            - third block
            - "For a former diplomat like me, I found it confusing: I kept looking for a hierarchy, the singular leader, or signs of a government line, when, in fact, there was none; there were just groups. There was none of that stifling obedience to the party, or the obsequious deference to the "big man"—a form of government all too evident just across the borders, in Turkey to the north, and the Kurdish regional government of Iraq to the south. The confident assertiveness of young people was striking. - seems kind of hobbesian
            - The main sources of revenue for the autonomous region have been presented as: 1. Public properties such as grain silos and oil and gas in the Jazira Region, 2. Local taxation and customs fees taken at the border crossings, 3. Service delivery, 4. Remittances from Iraq and Turkey, and 5. Local donation
            - Grigori
                - you can get centralized as much as you want, but if you have a hostile neighbor then the centralized system kind of falls apart
                - hostile enemy can crush you at any moment.
                - if you want to make a jump to a more powerful system you need centralization of some kind
            - Venkat
                - the continuing existence of conflict shows that things kind of continue the way they are regardless of how governance is implemented/imposed?
                - abstract governance rules exist
                - big data problem - vastly more data
                - they are caught between a rock and a hard place. This is like an ant between two cows and the two cows are backed by two elephants
                - asymetricality of small powers -  people survive regardless, all history will continue
                - think 5000 years in the past and 1000 years in the future. you just have to outlast the big powers
                - idealism exists for 10 minutes every 100 years 
        - [Disney Parks Essay Series by Cory Doctorow (index twitter thread)](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1419689975163936781?s=21)
            - Disney parks started as an escaped reality for Walt Disney, to manage his own psyche before it became a money making venture
            - Theme parks vs amusement parks - amusement parks focus on "gamification". Theme parks focus on Lore
            - [Tolkien on fairytales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fairy-Stories#:~:text=Tolkien%20suggests%20that%20fairy%20stories,changed%20by%20an%20outside%20perspective)
            - Cities are weakly escaped realities - https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/10/29/the-city-as-weakly-escaped-reality/
            - David Foster Wallace essays look at reality too hard in a way that if you look at it like DFW it does not end well
                - https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wallace-fun.html
            - Do you believe in your own lore?If you dont then you are being manipulative or an evil designer? 
            - Frontierland - https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/08/06/frontierland/
            - along with the Gatlinburg-style themed city, there are genuine cultural districts...Chinatown, etc.
            - We should design escaped realities, because everything is a simulation of a simulation of a simulation 
            - "gamification is the high fructose corn syrup of the internet" - the person who wrote this is now raising icelandic horses 
            - LARP is kind of like faking it till you make it but more sincere?
            - hobbesian design vs gaian design of theme parks 
        - [Hold me, I’m scared: Your guide to navigating the hold system](https://motionographer.com/2019/03/11/hold-me-im-scared-your-guide-to-navigating-the-hold-system/)
            - serious amount of money has to be involved for something like the hold system to exist
            - it seems like nobody is happy with this system or knows why it exists - better system does not exist thats why it exists 
            - Bryan - its a buyers market -  vast amount of talented people 
            - why would you have someone on staff vs augment with freelancers 
            - airline pilots have contract
            - Financial capital is much more concentrated, Talent is a power law, very technical industry 
            - unions have a huge influence 
            - start with non union premises and the most advanced technology available - this is kind of what indie movies do? 
            - DocumentaryDAO - by equipment + use money to buy equipment - lot of money and resources 
            - distribution - netflix - funding models are different and accept the union structure 
            - Lot of industries work in a similar way - people who are the top of the power law curve for whatever reason hold the power and the others are going to be the ones exploited in the system.
            - you could apply it to dating - its not a buyers market

                - Comparison of stated principles and actual operation
                - Organizations like Wiki need /listening function/. figure out what’s on the minds of contributors
                    - Wiki doesn’t seem to have listening function…not a recipe for success…invites trouble.
            - Matthew
                - Early wiki had a single wring-able neck.
                - BDFL is well-established, DAOs are trying to figure out how to do away with the model
                - The fork-exit seems rhetorical option vs an actual viable one for people who disagree.

                        - want to know more how that works
                - All the problems Wikipedia has
                    - maybe problems not solved by open-sourced style orgs
                    - open-source software projects often come out of unprofitable problems that companies can’t solve
                - Can DAOs change this
                    - DAOs as money raising functions for orgs like Wiki
                - To solve Wiki problems, it needs people who are paid to solve the problems
            - Scott

                    - forking isn’t a real option
                    - Wiki is one of those things that can only emerge once due to path-dependence
                    - not as bad as a state saying go found your own state
                    - hard part is the social engineering

            - Bryan
                - realizing what is a good idea to change and what are things that cannot be changed is a big part of governance 
                - yak collective - comfortable with everything being illegible, takes work to make it legible and there is no reward to making it legible 
                - energy levels of different projects - impressive that we meet every friday. got over the hurdle of having something worth spending time on. On the flip side, having the energy to get the paper done which is a high energy mode is harder. 
                - yak collective has a hobbyist approach that is different from amateur or pro
            - Matthew
                - leaving an artefact/time capsule of your experience 
                - putting pull requests on everything is interesting.
                - Having incentives aligned is needed for something like an "open" approach work
                - tension in the article between doing something vs realizing what is uncontrollable. how big of factor this is is unclear 
                - yak collective: reinforced the idea that non essential things are fun too. 
            - Venkat 
                - this one is written by a low agency rank and file person, who are not as constrained. First instinct was to be slightly bored by it. 
                - never hear this perspective anymore. 
                - For most people most of the things are unchangeable in the world, they see the universe as a spectator sport 
                - 2X2. agency vs constraint. 
                - whats unique about github - the pull request 
                - YC - there is literally no way to make somebody do something 
                - YC is high agency low constrain environment for people who have low to medium level constraints. high agency high constraint - constraints are clear
            - Grigori
                - all the titles are cliches
                - interesting question - what was the process of arriving at this cliche. fitting the narrative to cliche.
                - analyzed whats going on and arrived at cliches? 
                - we have to be careful with what we can learn from our experience, so that we dont arrive at the cliches. We should not fit the narrative of the cliche. 
        - Messi thread 
            - Sachin
                - Messi's style of play has to be complimented with a specific strategy that works for messi. which means other players have to sort of sacrifice or play a different role 
                - Also when messi works - seems like he does the work of 2-3 brilliant players at the same time. 
                - longer he goes in his career - has the charismatic effect - more defenders engage him which leads to srendipity for other players in other parts of the pitch and zemblanity for the opposition 
                - In most organizations there is a need to justify everything you do - exploratory periods are fewer - actual mistakes or things leading to dead ends are not admitted 
                - Messi was sick as a child and had lactic acid build up fast
                - Alexander technique/non judgemental awarness is curative
            - Grigori

                - wu-wei 
                - adapting around other players strength - more possible in soccer than other games - how much is it a function of the looseness of the rules 
                - modern war is more like soccer and older war is more like american football 
                - working around energy patterns. - similar to wind in the willows. instead of starting with a goal, start with what you are capable. 
                - where can I walk to that is more effective vs where can I run to

            - Sachin
                - “will post my comments since I likely won’t stay on for the call. I find such trad takes personally amusing since I grew up in a town that was full of small shops and stores that rapidly urbanized and gave way to fancier stores/restaurants, and everyone was really excited about it. I think that’s the primary difference I’ve noticed between the west and the developing world. Growing up in India, you had fewer resources and money but the tempo/mood of the narrative was clearly upward , you could see things changing around you and people were mostly excited for it. While after I moved to the US, I’ve access to more resources and money but it feels like I came in at the end of something and people are nostalgic for something”

                        - to do it, you’d need to 	know the history of NY street food
                - Meredith
                    - idea mazes aren’t something people actively do…seems like people just absorb them
                - Venkat
                    - half dozen founders that are idea mazes
                    - Conor from Roam did this

                    - “On idea mazes: there’s like a barren middle ground? You either know the space (in the present and historically) organically, or you’ve got no effing clue and project such a strong reality distortion field that unknowledge doesn’t matter. The middle ground (e.g. someone mechanically identifying an opportunity and trying to go to market)”

        - [Jesuits ](https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/jesuit/)
            - Bryan
                - trust in the jesuit system is high, didnt need to be watched. They trusted that other jesuits were doing the same thing as they were doing. 
                - what would not talking to peers look like in the internet world?  What does changing the frequency of activity mean?
                - Jesuits were good at PR - printing press
                - instance of path dependence - would the jesuits have existed in a place without the other infrastructure that existed around them? right people at the right place in the right time
                - bias on observing/orienting vs not acting 
            - Grigori
                - they had ambitious goals, because it clashed with traditional order they found ways to hide it 
                - The development of the school was very fast for the time in which it was developed 
                - they were very strict most of the time. 
                - the system that made them spread very fast seems unclear. Interested to know more about what happened initially 
                - they used printing press, but it does not follow from the article that competing movements did not use it?
            - Jenna
                - the letters when they arrived - how are the documents controlled, distributed, who decided what to print. internal decision making is unclear 
                - async model - has a lot of writing/documenting involved. would be interesting to see if it comes out as product output in some way 
            - Matthew 
                - first time reading about jesuits was - novel about jesuits??
                - they were providing legibility as a service - emphasis on translating documents, interfacing between different regions, describing what they were seeing. And thats what sucked a lot of people in 
                - royal patronage helped them to get to the boundaries of the empire or liminal spaces between them. wonder how being associated with the state changed it. what is akin to royal patronage that jesuits had?
                - tendency to document --> similar to everything being async by default. 
            - Venkat 
                - went to a jesuit school
                - couple of things that didnt come through -  in the period of printing press -> westaphalia, jesuits were late adopters to this. Pamphlet wars 
                - they became advisers for ...
                - jesuits were good at getting close to the rulers and becoming the consultant equivalents of the time. They were more about political influence rather than religious
                - jesuits - do most of things in the ears of rulers and not talk directly as much publicly 
                - reason they were travellers - complimenting the printing press - preventing the info from getting in the hands of others 
                - they had access to capital 
                - had a lot of local autonomy but not decentralized. big capital played a big role in projects 
                - reasons async communications worked - most of it was about money. Important things went through central authority 
                - they did a lot of predictive processing - send out advisory blog posts 
                - yak school operating more in that mode than we realize. letter writing was much more commmon and frequent. 6 mail deliveries a day. increased in tempo 
                - people spend hours reading and responding to letters
                - adapting to the medium.if there are long time delays you keep communicating hoping that some of it is useful. 
                - lot of military operations have to unfold in radio silence. same strategy. high level autonomy for local commanders. commanders set overall goal, local commanders have smaller goals and they have contracted agreements between them.  similar to how the jesuits do it. overall mission was clear - spread the religions. filling in the details would be not predictable exactly

            - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."

        - {{[[DONE]]}}  1. Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas. https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30
        - 2. The path to success for a platform venture is by no means easy or guaranteed, nor is it completely different from that of companies with more-conventional business models. Why? Because, like all companies, platforms must ultimately perform better than their competitors. In addition, to survive long-term, platforms must also be politically and socially viable.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} **The read** is an article based on the excellent book The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, et al. is here:

            - https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem
            - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing." 
It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.

        - 9. About Trust and Common Ground.
Given that lack of close connection and established trust, it’s also harder to develop the kind of common ground that facilitates productive interaction. The issues that people care about, the technical languages they speak, their modes of problem-solving, and their goals tend to diverge greatly when they work in different locations, specialize in different domains, and are responsible for different outcomes. It’s particularly challenging to bridge the gaps in understanding if they don’t know many people in common. The less employees know about each other’s motives and knowledge bases, research shows, the less inclined they are to share knowledge with each other. This can lead to more mistakes, slower project completion, and, in many cases, less innovative outcomes.

1. https://corporate-rebels.com/morning-star/
2. https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers

Prompt:
- In an ideal world, how would you like to be interacting with the Yak Collective in two years?
- Are there any first principles you think we should be operating from?
- As far as the meta goes, what do you think our priorities should be? What are blockers?

Today read may come as a little surprise. It is the most recent annual letter to shareholders, by Jeff Bezos.
https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
The prompt questions were:
            - How can we create value for people involved in The Yak Collective, potential clients, society at large?
            - Have we created something -- an idea, a process, a memorable phrase, a ritual, an artifact, ... , a bot, -- that can have lasting power, i.e. something that we will be able to refer to, say, 2, 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

            - Is it possible to create non-hierarchical social systems for humans? Power Distance. Lowest in Nordics, Israel and highest in Arab, Southeast Asian and Latin America. "Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modes that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice." "  one context in which a structureless organization can work; a very small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds" "Medieval Iceland from the [tenth to thirteenth centuries](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html) was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police. It lasted longer than US" "Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries" __Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?__ Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (“communication is only possible between equals.”)  One of the observations in __Wealth of Nations __is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we don’t have a solution to the problem of __preventing __them from emerging. __By default __an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. **When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just “is this a system I’d want to live under today?” but “how effective __will t__his system be in the __future __at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?”**
