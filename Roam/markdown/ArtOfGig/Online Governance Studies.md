- We meet every Friday on Discord Chat at 9 AM Pacific to read and discuss a short reading relevant to online governance. We have multiple reading tracks each with their queues, which you can find below. 
- For the 2021-22 season, we have 4 active tracks with active queues: Nature and Long-Term Thinking, Case Studies, Technology, and General. Please feel free to add links to any queue (preferred), or in the Discord ogs channel using the `$readingadd` command. The Discord list is used as an inbox/buffer and is periodically cleared and moved here.

        - {{[[DONE]]}} [Frederic Laloux points out the fragility of platforms. It is not the first time he is talking about it, of course.](https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Point-of-View/Frederic-Laloux-on-what-lies-ahead-for-business.html)
            - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."
            - [[Frederic Laloux]]
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  1. Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas. https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30
        - 2. The path to success for a platform venture is by no means easy or guaranteed, nor is it completely different from that of companies with more-conventional business models. Why? Because, like all companies, platforms must ultimately perform better than their competitors. In addition, to survive long-term, platforms must also be politically and socially viable.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} **The read** is an article based on the excellent book The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, et al. is here:
                - https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-future-of-platforms/
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  3. Do you need a business ecosystem?
            - https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem
            - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing." 
It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.
The article above is a part of a series, that include:

        - 9. About Trust and Common Ground.
Given that lack of close connection and established trust, it’s also harder to develop the kind of common ground that facilitates productive interaction. The issues that people care about, the technical languages they speak, their modes of problem-solving, and their goals tend to diverge greatly when they work in different locations, specialize in different domains, and are responsible for different outcomes. It’s particularly challenging to bridge the gaps in understanding if they don’t know many people in common. The less employees know about each other’s motives and knowledge bases, research shows, the less inclined they are to share knowledge with each other. This can lead to more mistakes, slower project completion, and, in many cases, less innovative outcomes.

        - {{[[DONE]]}} 10. A read on Valve recommended by [[Oliver King]]

        - {{[[DONE]]}} 12. The plan for the chat this coming Friday --

To keep rhythm and set the stage for discussion: a case study of organizational first principles. Please read the first article, feel free to skim the second for more color:

1. https://corporate-rebels.com/morning-star/
2. https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers

Prompt:
- In an ideal world, how would you like to be interacting with the Yak Collective in two years?
- Are there any first principles you think we should be operating from?
- As far as the meta goes, what do you think our priorities should be? What are blockers?
        - {{[[DONE]]}} 13. A surprise read:
Today read may come as a little surprise. It is the most recent annual letter to shareholders, by Jeff Bezos.
https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
The prompt questions were:
            - How can we create value for people involved in The Yak Collective, potential clients, society at large?
            - Have we created something -- an idea, a process, a memorable phrase, a ritual, an artifact, ... , a bot, -- that can have lasting power, i.e. something that we will be able to refer to, say, 2, 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

            - Is it possible to create non-hierarchical social systems for humans? Power Distance. Lowest in Nordics, Israel and highest in Arab, Southeast Asian and Latin America. "Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modes that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice." "  one context in which a structureless organization can work; a very small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds" "Medieval Iceland from the [tenth to thirteenth centuries](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html) was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police. It lasted longer than US" "Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries" __Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?__ Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (“communication is only possible between equals.”)  One of the observations in __Wealth of Nations __is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we don’t have a solution to the problem of __preventing __them from emerging. __By default __an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. **When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just “is this a system I’d want to live under today?” but “how effective __will t__his system be in the __future __at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?”**
