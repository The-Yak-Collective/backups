    - Topics covered
        - set the expectation on how marketing can help
            - we like to come early into the projects so we can instill a marketing perspective from the beginning - target, goals, outcomes, formats,...
            - At this point our objective is to help shape the overall marketing message to the target/goal/outcome 
            - We also might identify some opportunities and ideas that we can pursue together - channels, partnerships,...
        - get to know the project in more detail
            - unconventional approaches to making Innovation work in BigCorp
                - dual essays covering a Problem and a Solution
                - 8-10 essays x 2 
                - + intro and wrapping essay
            - Target persona 
                - Head of Innovation
                    - [[Hugo Macedo]]  they feel the pain of delivering and feel the problems and are interested in the solutions
                - CEOs
                    - [[Hugo Macedo]]  they are anxious to see the return on innovation, they are observing the symptoms of the problems (slow, misalignment, underwhelming, no business impact)
            - Goal for Yak Collective 
                - LeadGen - conversation starter with the target personas
                - Position YC in innovation consulting
            - Project deliverable options
                - Book - it was the initial idea, but the content is probably doesn't work as a full fledge book
                - ebook - a possible middle-ground - the expectations are so big as in a book,  and has a more finished and "meaty" piece than a series of blog posts
                - Series of blog posts
            - Project deadlines
                - Content finished till end of year
                - Launch in Jan 2021
        - Ideas to explore
            - Who can vouch for the project outside YC - can we share a pre-launch version so we can have a recommendation?
            - pick your problem - Interactive 
                - you see a mozaic of problem cards with some short description 
                - you can choose only one card to read the problem and the solution
                - or you can read all the problems and pick only one to see the solutions
                - makes you deliberately relate to a problem - and admit "Yes I have this problem"
            - Book with 2 covers and in reverse orientation (upside down from each other)
                - remember when there were books with puzzles with a solutions page?
                - the solutions pages were written upside down so you could not easily peek ;) 
                - if we ever print the book we could explore this idea - 2 covers, one for problems other for solutions
    - Next Steps
        - topic to be discussed in the next #[[YC Marketing]] sync
        - [[Hugo Macedo]] to read the content to know more about the product
        - [[Hugo Macedo]] to explore ideas to launch including format and channels
        - [[Hugo Macedo]] to comeback to [[David McDougall]] with additional questions and ideas
