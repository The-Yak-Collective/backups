    - > MAIN CONCEPTS
    - > Distributed systems algorithms can be classified according to different kinds of attributes. Some classifications are: the timing model; the kind of interprocess communication used; the failure model assumed for the algorithm; and many others as we will see.
    - Here are the main concepts we will see:
    - Timing Model
    - > synchronous model, the asynchronous model and the partially synchronous model
    - Interprocess Communication
    - > do it by sending messages to each other, in the **message passing** model, or by using the **shared memory** model, where they share data by accessing shared variables
    - > queues and stacks [...] 
    - > consistency properties, like linearizabilty
    - > We should not confuse _shared memory_ as a way to share data between processes by accessing a shared variable with _shared memory abstractions_ built on top of message passing
    - > the Perfect Links abstraction that has reliable delivery and sends no duplicates; this abstraction also assures exactly once delivery.
    - Failure Modes
    - > process failures
    - > crash-stop failure mode
    - > crash-recovery model
    - > omission failure modes
    - > Byzantine or arbitrary failure modes
    - Failure Detectors
    - > Perfect Failure detectors
    - > Eventually Perfect Failure Detector type [...] **Strong Completeness**: Eventually, every process that crashes is permanently suspected by every correct process. **Eventual Strong Accuracy**: Eventually, no correct process is suspected by any correct process.
    - Leader Election
    - > 
    - Consensus
    - > The consensus or agreement problem
    - > a problem of reaching agreement among independent processes
    - > propose and decide functions
    - > properties[...] Termination, Validity, Integrity and Agreement
    - Quorums
    - > Quorums are a tool used for designing fault-tolerant distributed systems. Quorums refer to intersecting sets of processes that can be used to understand the characteristic of a sytem when some processes might fail
    - Time in Distributed Systems
    - > Logical Clocks... a way of assigning a number to an event in the system; said numbers are not related to the actual passage of time, but to the processing of events by a node in a distributed system.
    - > many kinds of logical clocks algorithms, like Vector Clocks or Interval Tree Clocks
