            - An anthology of short speculative fiction developed from the networked thoughts of 30 indie consultants 
        - ^^{{[[TODO]]}} long description^^
`something real clear but interesting (not too poetic, but also not too dry) - if you have the dry-version we can later edit the copywrite`
            - The upside of an extremely uncertain environment is that we have been free to purely indulge in speculation about the future. The result is Astonishing Stories, an anthology of short speculative fiction developed from the networked thoughts of over 30 Indie consultants. 

Our working process is open and visible to all on our Roam Graph. The future fragments were developed by Indie consultants from different industries and experience levels through playing sessions of The Thing From The Future. The fragments provided a jumping-off point for authors of short speculative fiction and can be used by anyone to develop stories of their own or speculate on the post-covid world

The stories here are not meant to predict the future but to be imagination extenders for entrepreneurs and consultants navigating a post-Covid landscape 
        - ^^Questionnaire to feed the messaging^^
            - `Answering these questions will help us build the right content/messaging to market the project`
                - `Who are you? "about the team to emphasise relevant experience"`
                    - 30+ indie consultants with various levels of experience, from all over the world. Amanda Reeves, one of the lead editors runs a strategic foresight consulting practice. The story writers come from different backgrounds - tech, consulting, product manager, growth marketer, researcher and bring a diversity of perspective 
                - `Why did you decided to embark on this project? `
                    - science fiction seemed like an indulgent way to think about the future when the whole world is experiencing some form of a sense of foreshortened future 
                - `Why is this relevant to executives or other consultants? `
                    - The stories are not meant to predict the future but to be imagination extenders to think about the future, make decisions and to be comfortable with uncertainty 
                - `Why now? `
                    - The pandemic has gone from being the main event to be the background for other events to take place, we wanted to explore what this would be like 
                - `What was the process to arrive to this stories? `
                    - We organized sessions of[ A Thing From The Future ](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/)where over 30 indie consultants came together to create future fragments and scenarios that described objects from the future. 
                    - These future fragments and scenarios were organized in a Roam Graph which was used by writers to create stories by combining, remixing and connecting these ideas 
                - `What's next?`
                    - Want to create a story? Visit the Roam Graph and create your own and see our process
                    - Get in touch with Yak Collective to get a diverse perspective of the future about your industry/company 
                - What does the story make you feel like
                - [[October 22nd, 2020]]
                    - The upside of an extremely uncertain environment is that we have been free to indulge in pure speculation about the know knowns and unknown unknowns of the future. The result is __Astonishing Stories__, an anthology of short speculative fiction developed from the networked thoughts of over 30 indie consultants.
                    - Our working process is open and visible to all on our [Roam graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/graph) where we developed provoking descriptions of objects from the near and far future using [The Thing From The Future. ](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/). The objects served as jumping off points for our authors as they tried to imagine a world in which the pandemic is the background event for other shifts. 
                    - The stories here are not meant to predict the future but to be imagination extenders for entrepreneurs and consultants navigating a post-COVID landscape.
