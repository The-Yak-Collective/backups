- build team leader:: [[Maier Fenster]]
- other team members:: TBD
- official name under consideration:: wonderful wandering growth
- design::
    - right now looks like design will be a legged robot, with a twist (literally, as a joint) that allows at least some of the legs to meet as arms or at least pinchers
    - the goal is that we are not making just a rover, but rather a bot that can also move but also do stuff. it seems to make sense that at least some bot parts be as multi-use as possible
    - perhaps rover will go around trying to both find things of wonder (to itself) and grow (or grow the world)
    - looks like it will be based on hiwonder spiderpi, but checking into another design
- other stuff::
    - working with [[Eric Platon]] on software and hardware control of spider pi
    - working with [[Eric Platon]] on multi-user software
