    - Strategic tracks take some of the guesswork of maintaining a column/or a flow of content for the newsletter.
    - We will never be able to describe or brand YC exactly, but we __can__ do this with the newsletter.
    - Proposing an additional newsletter for YC-generated fiction.

    - Description of Yak Collective:
        - "The Yak Collective is an experimental network-governed organization made up of over 300 independent consultants, coaches, and freelancers with varied technical and creative skills. The goal is to allow indie consultants to band together and compete at the scale of large bureaucratic consultancies (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, etc) while maintaining their complete autonomy."

    - Good starting point for this week for [[Online Governance Studies]] track https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1281632821056954369?s=20
    - "Writing is about 20% of the work."
        - The rest of the work is __product work__.
            - To put out a really good product on a regular basis. 
                - **"We need two engines" **
                    - 1. A content engine – We need to produce content every week.
                    - 2. An external engine – We need to look at analytics of newsletter to see what people are reading, and what they are responding to
    - Re: writing for complexity
        - A lot of consulting businesses do "complexity management"
            - Yak Collective can outcompete the big guys
- [[Grigori Milov]]
    - We should create our own dashboard
