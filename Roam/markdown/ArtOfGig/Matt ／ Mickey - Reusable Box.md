- Key Qs
    - What “market wedge” __might __OceanSix choose for the product, which will enable market penetration with low risk?
        - The answer __should__ include a general proposed path to success and the reasoning behind it
        - No requirement, but definitely a plus, to refer to specific competitors or potential collaborators in any particular suggested niche
    - What modifications __should__ be made to the product to make it suitable for that market wedge?
- Outline
    - Market wedge: **medical / healthcare / clinical supplies**
        - Why?
            - High volume / throughput of products
                - Diversity of services and materials
                - Continuous nature of service function and provision
                - Minimum orders for products (provider or supplier mandated)
            - High value of products
                - Cost / value of specialised consumables / items and liquids
                - Sensitivity of specialised consumables / items and liquids
                - Bulk value of generic consumables / items and liquids
                - Example products
                    - Clinical consumables / items
                    - Laboratory consumables / items
                    - Laboratory liquids
                    - Generic liquids
            - Multiple vectors of packaging movement
                - Supplier >>> site
                - Site >>> supplier
                - Delivery location >>> centralised site store
                - Delivery location >>> centralised department / team store
                - Site store >>> departments / teams / functions
            - Established patterns of packaging movement
                - No need to incentivise / engineer new behaviours
            - Discrete use cases enable experimentation, verification, targeted rollout
                - Discrete via product line / items
                - Discrete via teams / departments / functions
                - Discrete via suppliers / organisations
                - Discrete via packaging movement vector
            - B2B with >1 well-resourced, innovation-focused party
                - Hospitals / healthcare providers that are incredibly resource-sensitive
                - Departments / teams relying on inefficient, labour-intensive workarounds
                - Resource-rich suppliers that are incentivised to appear innovative / sustainable
            - Current materials
                - One-use plastic wrappers for regulated / clinical consumables
                - Plastic / paper / sawdust for outer-inner fillers, spill protection, buffers
                - Cardboard for whole delivery packaging and unit / pack packaging
                - Various one-use tapes used for sealing inner and outer packaging
                - Adhesive document sleeves for delivery notes / information
            - Distribution and reception of packaging
                - Cardboard doesn't protect valuable / sensitive contents during distribution
                - Nested cardboard boxes are excessive and not effective utilisers of space
                - Distribution often via third-party couriers / logistics orgs
            - Reception and processing of packaging
                - Larger packaging must be unsealed, entered, decomposed and collected
                - One-use / filler / buffer plastics and spillage protection must be discarded
                - Smaller unit / packs as above, or stacked in centralised stores
            - Storage and re-use of packaging
                - Some packaging stored (unsafely / inefficiently) for intra-site distribution
                - Extra depots / network paths required for packaging storage / circulation
                - Some packaging becomes default form factor for stores
                - Various tapes used for sealing inner and outer packaging that is reused
                - Adhesive document sleeves for notes / information during reuse
            - Return and disposal of packaging
                - Unstored / non-reused packaging wasted or industrially recycled
                - Certain packaging (e.g. laboratory liquids) kept, re-filled and returned (encased in stored/saved packaging from previous deliveries)
    - Modifications (generic) for selected market wedge
        - Integrated document / note / info sleeve on exterior
        - Standardised form factors aligned with existing packaging form factors
        - Built-in sealing / closure mechanisms
        - Inserts for item / inner package stabilisation
        - Inserts for item / inner package segregation
        - Compatible with cleaning / sterilisation processes
        - Collapsible and small storage footprint for re-use and return

        - Involved parties:
            - Wholesale/warehouse
            - Transport
            - Receiver:
hospital/pharmacy/reseller
        - Packaging design constraints / modifications
            - Temperature sensor with memory – cold chain consistency check
            - Lock/seal – integrity check
            - Additional cooling pads/gels/insulation bags for lower temperatures (currently 2-3°c/ 4°c for 12-48 hours.)
            - The mobile app combined with a QR code for administrative parts (input, output, signing…) App backend can be on blockchain to prevent retroactive tracking information changes. The blockchain part can sound like a gimmick, so we need to discuss it.
        - Movement/flow:
            - Wholesale/warehouse: goods are packaged appropriately, the temperature sensor is started, the box is sealed/locked, the app scans the box QR code, the operator enters the data about the shipment, shipment is transferred to transportation
            - Transportation: courier scans the QR code of the box, and carries it to the destination, and transport is done in the cold chamber.
            - Receiver: the receiver scans the QR code of the box, unlocks/unseals the box, opens, reads the sensor data, confirms shipment in the app, and stores the goods appropriately. If there were inappropriate temperature swings, the shipment is compromised, flagged in the app, and sent back.
            - Circular part: two options: one is that the box is sent back empty. The other that it is filled with medical waste, sealed, and sent for waste management, then cleaned and sent back.
    - Central stores for intra-site circulation of items:
        - Involved parties:
            - Central warehouse
            - Optional courier
            - Receiver: hospital
ward/room
        - Packaging design constraints / modifications
            - Additional inlays for easier transport of different things
            - Spill-proofing
            - The mobile app combined with a QR code for administrative parts (input, output, signing…)
        - Movement/flow:
            - Warehouse: goods are packaged appropriately, the app scans the box QR code, the operator enters the output order, goods are taken by the receiver (who scans the QR code and accepts the input order) or optionally given to the courier
            - Courier (optional): courier scans the QR code of the box, carries it to the destination
            - Receiver: the receiver scans the QR code of the box, opens the box, confirms the input order, and stores the goods appropriately.
            - Circular part: the receiver send/takes the box back to the warehouse to be ready for the next transfer. The other option is that the box is used as a medical locker within the hospital room.
