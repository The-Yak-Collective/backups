- Key Qs
    - What “market wedge” __might __OceanSix choose for the product, which will enable market penetration with low risk?
        - The answer __should__ include a general proposed path to success and the reasoning behind it
        - No requirement, but definitely a plus, to refer to specific competitors or potential collaborators in any particular suggested niche
    - What modifications __should__ be made to the product to make it suitable for that market wedge?
- Outline
    - Market wedge: **medical / healthcare / clinical supplies**
        - Why?
            - High volume / throughput of products
                - Diversity of services and materials
                - Continuous nature of service function and provision
                - Minimum orders for products (provider or supplier mandated)
            - High value of products
                - Cost / value of specialised consumables / items and liquids
                - Sensitivity of specialised consumables / items and liquids
                - Bulk value of generic consumables / items and liquids
                - Example products
                    - Clinical consumables / items
                    - Laboratory consumables / items
                    - Laboratory liquids
                    - Generic liquids
            - Multiple vectors of packaging movement
                - Supplier >>> site
                - Site >>> supplier
                - Delivery location >>> centralised site store
                - Delivery location >>> centralised department / team store
                - Site store >>> departments / teams / functions
            - Discrete use cases enable experimentation, verification, targeted rollout
                - Discrete via product line / items
                - Discrete via teams / departments / functions
                - Discrete via suppliers / organisations
                - Discrete via packaging movement vector
            - B2B with >1 well-resourced, innovation-focused party
                - Hospitals / healthcare providers that are incredibly resource-sensitive
                - Departments / teams relying on inefficient, labour-intensive workarounds
                - Resource-rich suppliers that are incentivised to appear innovative / sustainable
            - Current materials
                - One-use plastic wrappers for regulated / clinical consumables
                - Plastic / paper / sawdust for outer-inner fillers, spill protection, buffers
                - Cardboard for whole delivery packaging and unit / pack packaging
                - Various one-use tapes used for sealing inner and outer packaging
                - Adhesive document sleeves for delivery notes / information
            - Distribution and reception of packaging
                - Cardboard doesn't protect valuable / sensitive contents during distribution
                - Nested cardboard boxes are excessive and not effective utilisers of space
                - Distribution often via third-party couriers / logistics orgs
            - Reception and processing of packaging
                - Larger packaging must be unsealed, entered, decomposed and collected
                - One-use / filler / buffer plastics and spillage protection must be discarded
                - Smaller unit / packs as above, or stacked in centralised stores
            - Storage and re-use of packaging
                - Some packaging stored (unsafely / inefficiently) for intra-site distribution
                - Extra depots / network paths required for packaging storage / circulation
                - Some packaging becomes default form factor for stores
                - Various tapes used for sealing inner and outer packaging that is reused
                - Adhesive document sleeves for notes / information during reuse
            - Return and disposal of packaging
                - Unstored / non-reused packaging wasted or industrially recycled
                - Certain packaging (e.g. laboratory liquids) kept, re-filled and returned (encased in stored/saved packaging from previous deliveries)
    - Modifications (generic) for selected market wedge
        - Integrated document / note / info sleeve on exterior
        - Standardised form factors aligned with existing packaging form factors
        - Built-in sealing / closure mechanisms
        - Inserts for item / inner package stabilisation
        - Inserts for item / inner package segregation
        - Compatible with cleaning / sterilisation processes
        - 
        - Shipping / distribution form factors vs smaller, on-site form factors
        - Collapsible and small storage footprint for re-use and return
    - Entry-points / scenarios
        - Possible cases
            - Cold chain control and verification
            - Central stores for intra-site circulation of items
            - Laboratory liquid packaging distribution and return
            - Targeted site-supplier product line packaging upgrade
        - For each
            - Interested / involved parties
            - Diagram / mapping of movement / ecosystem
            - Packaging design constraints / modifications
