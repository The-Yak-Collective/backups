- Conceptual creative with a background in comparative literature, media labs, archives, conceptual art, experimental poetics, monetary art, communication & marketing, and financial technology. Believes that smart contractual primordial soup is genuine, & hedging our species against the entropic decay of both natural events, and the biases of masses, or atomic sub-DAOs such as an individual. 

Jumped on the decentralization orbit whilst contemplating (qualitatively) upon that MA thesis wherein a significant amount of futurist shit-posting flirts with longevity, digital objects, gaming, conceptual arts with blockchain technology in theory. 

Decided to learn what the heck that non-fungible format was, and is, at around early 2020 without any prior knowledge of financial technology, composability, game theory, coordination etc. (The Smithsâ€”Sweet and Tender Hooligan intervenes). Been minting, trading, and actively power-using anything decentralized since then. Some say he an artist, others gym shark.
