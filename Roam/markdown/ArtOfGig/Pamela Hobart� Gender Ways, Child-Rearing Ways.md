- Gender ways initial thoughts: 
    - Instead of speculating about gendered "brain differences," you would be able to discern the actual differences between two individuals (regardless of their genders) - completely sidesteps "gender" as a discrete issue? Post-gender?
    - Could this settle issues about gendered brain differences? But it's not really a factual question, more of a sociocultural touchpoint in the gender wars

- Child-Rearing ways: 
    - Real-time feedback on attachment behaviors (the "good enough" mother)
    - Are you traumatizing your child? neural correlates of "adverse childhood experiences" retrospectively - but can you figure them out ex ante
    - Figuring out what pre-verbal children want: is this a huge boon to old attachment mechanisms, or does it thwart individuation? (traffic jam possibility)
    - "Assisted Attunement" - split the difference between attachment & helicopter parenting in evidence-based manner
