                - A lot's changed since early 2020. One thing hasn't; the @yak_collective continues to slouch towards another completed year. Its third.
                - To mark the occasion—and to usher in 2023—a week-long interactive tinkering session is taking place.

                        - Asynchronous explorations led by YC track leads.
            - gist/gestalt
                - The core of YC is synchronous study, collab and tinkering sessions with async research and comms. Both occur at an easy, sustainable tempo with an infinite game outlook.
                - YakCon reflects this. It's a week-long interactive tinkering session.
            - sign-up link
                - YakCon isn't a broadcast. It's not your typical AGM. It's a participatory open house. Come by and check it out.

        - Draft
            - YakCon nears.
            - It's a week-long interactive tinkering session hosted by the Yak Collective, with two virtual meetups (on Sunday 8th and 15th Jan) joined by a week of asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord.
            - You can register for it here: https://lu.ma/yakcon
            - (And you probably should; it's approaching max viable capacity)
            - Or you can stick around and learn more about what YakCon Part One, YakCon Part Two and the spanning Async Week actually involve...
            - The plan for YakCon Part One and Two?
            - Both sessions will begin with a quick introduction to the Yak Collective and either a quick review of 2022 (Part One) or a quick preview of 2023 (Part Two). This will be followed by our guest speakers.
            - In Part One, Killian Butler will give us some insight into productising machine learning research.
            - He knows a little (actually, a lot) about this; he's Head of Product at Papercup. They're working on rapid, automated dubbing that preserves the expressivity of the original content.
            - In Part Two, we'll be hearing from Mike Casey and Dan Grover.
            - Mike will be tackling a difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?" 
            - He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity — whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences).
            - Dan—designer, engineer, entrepreneur—will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.
            - Once the speakers have spoke (and fielded some challenging questions), we can get into the actual activities of YC. The infinite games currently being played by us.
            - We'll take a brief tour through:
                - Rover building and distributed systems studies
                - The Fermi Gym
                - Governance studies
                - Infrastructure activities
                - YC's pop-up consulting projects
                - [[YakFit-💪]]
            - Some other nascent activities will probably get a namedrop, too.
            - In Part One, this round robin will be more focused on recent activity. In Part Two, there'll be a little more focus on upcoming activities and possibilities.
            - With the all-hands ticked off, the breakouts begin.
            - In these, you'll be able to participate in a session based on some recurring YC activities:
                - The Fermi Gym OR robotics and distributed systems studies (Breakout A)
                - Infrastructure OR governance studies (Breakout B)
            - Breakouts in Part One will lay the groundwork for things taking place during Async Week. "Async Week" is a fancy name for asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord. Breakouts in Part Two will bring together the efforts from Part One and Async Week.
            - The end of the breakout sessions marks the end of the event for the day. To close, there may be a few comments, some questions or even a discussion.
            - And we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a secret afterparty.

            - YakCon Part One is done. We had around thirty participants (+/- 5) for the full four hour session. There was a mixture of active and inactive Yaks, as well as some newcomers; approx. 40% of attendees were new to YC or returning from a hiatus.
            - Far from being a snooze fest, the consensus is that YakCon whizzed by. Here's a recap that may indicate why.
            - Killian Butler ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/kilianbutler), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kilianbutler)) kicked us off with an engaging talk around the theme of productising machine learning research. "Is model failure indicative of product failure?" "Where does margin accrue in the AGI supply chain?" These questions (and more) were explored.
            - We then took a whirlwind tour of sustained YC activity areas—such as governance and distributed system studies, infrastructure and the Fermi Gym—as well as an overview of YC's emerging pop-up consulting methodology.
            - Following the all-hands, we had one breakout session that allowed participants to:
                - Enter the Fermi Gym and attempt a roughly-right answer to a sensor-focused problem
                - Orient themselves in the terrain of distributed robotics via a pebble automata puzzle
            - The second breakout session was a little lighter. Participants were able to:
                - Read an essay on rules and discuss their common invocations (as models, as algorithms, as laws)
                - Receive an introduction to YC's infrastructure and ideate opportunities for expansion, improvement and experimentation
            - Thus passed the hours.
            - Now, we're into YakCon's Async Week. Below is a breakdown of what's happening.
            - ## Async Week Activities
                - ### Distributed systems and robotics
                    - Monday 9th Jan, 1600 UTC: the regular distributed systems reading group (focused on cache coherence, a gnarly computer science issue).
                    - Tuesday 10th Jan, 2000 UTC: the regular robotics group, this week involving a demo and discussion of SLAM navigation in the Unity game engine.
                    - Every day: a new item will be selected from the accrued reading list, as well as arbitrary Discord chatter.
                - ### Governance studies
                    - Friday 15th Jan, 1700 UTC, the regular governance studies session which will involve a rules-focused reading and dialogue.
                    - Throughout the week: informal chatter and link-drops in the Discord.
                - ### The Fermi Gym
                    - Throughout the week: self-paced answering of some Fermi Gym questions (an easy, medium and hard option available) alongside informal discussion and analysis.
                - ### Infrastructure
                    - Throughout the week: a self-paced ideation session focused on the evolving YC infrastructure (which can span design, UX etc. as well as code).
                    - Thursday 14th Jan: a potential pop-up sync session based on activity and discussion.
                - ### YakFit
                    - Throughout the week: a self-paced, health/fitness-focused, week-long experiment (options include lux exposure, a supplement trial and slooooow movement).
                - ​You'll need access to the YC Discord to take part in any of the above. Go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to get it.
            - ## Towards YakCon Part Two
                - After Async Week, we get to YakCon Part Two.
                - It follows the same structure as Part One (and it's at the same time; 1600 UTC this coming Sunday), and it will be friendly to those who missed Part One and/or Async Week. We'll have two guest speakers for this session, though.
                - We'll be hearing from Mike Casey ([Farcaster](http://fcast.me/mc), [personal site](https://mcasey.xyz/)). He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity — whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences). He'll be tackling the difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?"
                - We'll also be hearing from Dan Grover ([personal site](http://dangrover.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangrover/)). Dan—designer, engineer, entrepreneur—will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.
                - Sounds good, right? So get to it. Register for YakCon Part Two [here](https://lu.ma/yakcon) and go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to access to the YC Discord.
