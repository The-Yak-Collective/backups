            - agenda and intro
                - A lot's changed since early 2020. One thing hasn't; the @yak_collective continues to slouch towards another completed year. Its third.
                - To mark the occasionâ€”and to usher in 2023â€”a week-long interactive tinkering session is taking place.

                    - ### YakCon: Async | Monday Jan 9th to Saturday Jan 14th
                        - Asynchronous explorations led by YC track leads.
            - gist/gestalt
                - The core of YC is synchronous study, collab and tinkering sessions with async research and comms. Both occur at an easy, sustainable tempo with an infinite game outlook.
                - YakCon reflects this. It's a week-long interactive tinkering session.
            - sign-up link
                - YakCon isn't a broadcast. It's not your typical AGM. It's a participatory open house. Come by and check it out.

        - Draft
            - YakCon nears.
            - It's a week-long interactive tinkering session hosted by the Yak Collective, with two virtual meetups (on Sunday 8th and 15th Jan) joined by a week of asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord.
            - You can register for it here:Â https://lu.ma/yakcon
            - (And you probably should; it's approaching max viable capacity)
            - Or you can stick around and learn more about what YakCon Part One, YakCon Part Two and the spanning Async Week actually involve...
            - The plan for YakCon Part One and Two?
            - Both sessions will begin with a quick introduction to the Yak Collective and either a quick review of 2022 (Part One) or a quick preview of 2023 (Part Two). This will be followed by our guest speakers.
            - In Part One, Killian Butler will give us some insight into productising machine learning research.
            - He knows a little (actually, a lot) about this; he's Head of Product at Papercup. They're working on rapid, automated dubbing that preserves the expressivity of the original content.
            - In Part Two, we'll be hearing from Mike Casey and Dan Grover.
            - Mike will be tackling a difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?" 
            - He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity â€” whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences).
            - Danâ€”designer, engineer, entrepreneurâ€”will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.
            - Once the speakers have spoke (and fielded some challenging questions), we can get into the actual activities of YC. The infinite games currently being played by us.
            - We'll take a brief tour through:
                - Rover building and distributed systems studies
                - The Fermi Gym
                - Governance studies
                - Infrastructure activities
                - YC's pop-up consulting projects
                - [[YakFit-ðŸ’ª]]
            - Some other nascent activities will probably get a namedrop, too.
            - In Part One, this round robin will be more focused on recent activity. In Part Two, there'll be a little more focus on upcoming activities and possibilities.
            - With the all-hands ticked off, the breakouts begin.
            - In these, you'll be able to participate in a session based on some recurring YC activities:
                - The Fermi Gym OR robotics and distributed systems studies (Breakout A)
                - Infrastructure OR governance studies (Breakout B)
            - Breakouts in Part One will lay the groundwork for things taking place during Async Week. "Async Week" is a fancy name for asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord. Breakouts in Part Two will bring together the efforts from Part One and Async Week.
            - The end of the breakout sessions marks the end of the event for the day. To close, there may be a few comments, some questions or even a discussion.
            - And we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a secret afterparty.
