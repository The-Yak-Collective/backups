                - YakCon is a week-long interactive tinkering session.
                - Its two live, collaborative events—Part One (Sunday Jan 8th, 1600-2000 UTC) and Part Two (Sunday Jan 15th, 1600-2000 UTC)—book-end a week of distributed, asynchronous explorations.
                - Events include guest speakers, a look at what The Yak Collective was up to in 2022, a glimpse of what's on the horizon for 2023, and breakout activities for some central YC activities, such as the Fermi gym, governance studies and the rover project.

                - Come join us at YakCon
                - A lot's changed since early 2020. One thing hasn't: the Yak Collective continues to slouch towards another year. It’s third. To mark the occasion—and to usher in 2023—we're holdng a week-long interactive tinkering session: **YakCon**.

                - The core of YC is synchronous study, collab, and tinkering sessions with async research and comms. Both occur at an easy, sustainable tempo with an infinite game outlook.
                - YakCon reflects this. It's a week-long interactive tinkering session. It isn't a broadcast. It's not your typical AGM. It's a participatory open house.
