                - Previously the act of traveling from space to space was a ritual that prepared us for different activities: work, exercise, sleep. How can we replace this previously invisible and automatic experience?

            - The Dishwasher. The Laundry Machine. Each came with the promise to save our labor, but the efficiency gains were unevenly distributed & female homemakers were left holding the vacuum cleaner bag

            - Much of the order imposed on us by institutions in the pre-COVID world has disappeared, and we are left to plan new routines to get us through our days. But it’s hard to plan for spontaneity

                - From the outside knowledge work is inscrutable: the worker leaves in the morning holding a coffee, and returns hours later empty-handed. Remote work gives the whole family a new understanding

                    - Many assumptions that made children living in multiple split-custody homes invisible to the system are colliding with new pandemic realities—forcing parents to operate in uncharted legal grey areas
                    - The more general issue is demographic legibility, and its tradeoffs.

- __2. Places & Spaces____ __ **(Drew presents)**
    - Drew talks about 1/3 space 
    - Drew talks about travel as ritual
    - **Drew invites Shreeda** to say a few words about A New Old Pattern Language
        - When considering issues of scale, it would be valuable to have a resource we can turn to. Hence I think we can look back to A Pattern Language, which was revolutionary in its publication, and whose many principles can still laterally transform and adapt to any situation. 
        - 
        - But with Covid exaggerating the demands, the density of use-cases all packed within a single home, recasting these patterns will be valuable. We may need to think of incorporating more unconventional solutions for fitting some of these patterns, especially with the place technology has in our lives. 
        - 
        - Jordan Peacock actually suggested the idea of cues, so instead of transitioning from space to space in a modular fashion, maybe you simply change clothes, or you have 2 separate lighting systems for the same space and switch between depending on contexts. 
        - 
        - 
I sort of wrote of experimental attempt mainly basing a hypothetical new language off of Venkat's concept of Farcaster Mansion, so we could have portals between the four different worlds. Or we can actually begin to give patterns that work with our tech tools, embrace them, and outfit nooks designed for ring lights, selfie sticks, or Zoom calls, etc. Just some ideas.

    - Visible Knowledge Work
    - The Knowledge Work Apprenticeship

- __5. Families in the New Old Home____ __ (Pamela presents)
    - You really can't talk about work separate from families, as the school/daycare/home dichotomy for children is breaking down at the same time as the work/home dichotomoy is collapsing for adults
    - Intergenerational living
    - **Pamela invites Jordan** to say a few words about pandemic coparenting
        - Many assumptions that made children living in multiple split-custody homes invisible to the system are colliding with new pandemic realities—forcing parents to operate in uncharted legal grey areas
        - The more general issue is demographic legibility, and its tradeoffs.
            - Home as a dynamic series of locations and a tempo of moving between them.
            - Households, not necessarily families

- __ 6. Towards the New Old Home____ __ **(Drew presents)**
    - Section()s) tbd
- 6:00
- Back to Pamela - "Making of" Discussion/learnings
    - So as you can see we have a bunch of ideas loosely clustered around the NOH idea. 
    - We were able to get this together pretty quickly because...
    - I had limited capacity to manage because I have 3 kids under age 5 and no childcare at the time...
    - 
- 6:10
- 6:20
- **Turn to Shreeda to choose questions out of the chat **- 
    - depending on if there are questions in there or not or if not too many attendees, could have them raise hands 
- 6:30
- 
- Topic ideas:
    - Childcare/education
    - 
- 
- 
- Intro/Overview **(Jordan starts)**

    5. **Pamela** introduces "New Old Home" concept
    5. Bios

            - Previously the act of traveling from space to space was a ritual that prepared us for different activities: work, exercise, sleep. How can we replace this previously invisible and automatic experience?

        - Early 2019 Venkat flagged a rapidly growing trend: the rise of Domestic Cozy. Stay-at-home orders have forced a whole new level of intensity, potentially solidifying it into a permanent posture for Gen Z

        - The Dishwasher. The Laundry Machine. Each came with the promise to save our labor, but the efficiency gains were unevenly distributed & female homemakers were left holding the vacuum cleaner bag

        - Much of the order imposed on us by institutions in the pre-COVID world has disappeared, and we are left to plan new routines to get us through our days. But it’s hard to plan for spontaneity

            - Ancient Greek city-states shifted power from Oikos (the family & the home) to Polis (society, “politics”). Covid-19 has shifted the power back. The question is, is this permanent?

            - From the outside knowledge work is inscrutable: the worker leaves in the morning holding a coffee, and returns hours later empty-handed. Remote work gives the whole family a new understanding

                - Many assumptions that made children living in multiple split-custody homes invisible to the system are colliding with new pandemic realities—forcing parents to operate in uncharted legal grey areas
                - The more general issue is demographic legibility, and its tradeoffs.
                    - Home as a dynamic series of locations and a tempo of moving between them.
