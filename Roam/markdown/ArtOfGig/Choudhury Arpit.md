- Hi! Iâ€™m Arpit, an independent growth/product marketing consultant based in Kolkata, India.
    - I like to think about the big challenges we are facing as a society, work on challenging problems, and challenge the status quo.
    - I'm driven by building value and not by personal gain. 
    - Software excites me, great software makes me want to jump!
    - I'm a huge proponent of tools that enable non-technical folks to do stuff that was previously only possible with code.
    - If I like something, I tend to sell it to everybody. 
    - Software excites me, great software makes me want to jump!
    - I revel in the fact that I'm a jack of all trades.
    - If I like something, I tend to sell it to everybody.
    - If I dislike something, I tend to prevent others from buying into it.
    - In particular, I am good at selling my ideas and writing about them.
    - 2020 has been a strange year -- I have gained so much but lost even more.
    - I get paid to engage people who use certain software tools.

    - I am passionate about contributing to communities
    - I prefer written over verbal communication.
    - I think remote work is a boon.
        - Right now (Aug 2020), I spend a bulk of my time helping [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com) grow.
        - The rest of my time goes into building [Data-led Academy](http://dataled.academy/) -- an initiative to foster data-literacy amongst non-engineers. 
- I spend too much time thinking about data, automation, and APIs, and how I can enable a large number of people to learn about them. 
- And when I'm not thinking about data, automation, and APIs, I like to talk to my dog and cook with my wife.
