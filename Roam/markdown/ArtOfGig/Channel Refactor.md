- About:: Part of the [[Meta-Project]] activity track and an iteration upon [[Discord Channel Lifecycle and Organization]]; intended to be first steps of a program that provides structure to desirable activities with the premise that __everything__ about the YC experience should be revolve around __doing__ interesting things
- Created:: [[April 12th, 2021]] by [[Oliver King]]
- **First Proposal -- Taxonomy**
    - **Problem**
        - There's a sense of overwhelm at the number of channels, mostly ghost-towns
        - Newcomers don't know where to start, how to engage, or how to act
    - **Solution**
        - Focus attention toward 'general' chat channels in the Plaza to concentrate chatter and serve as a starting line for unaffiliated Yaks and newcomers; deprecation of 'Discussion' as a category
        - More distinct categories with high intrinsic engagement: projects, work groups, and study groups
        - Sort lower engagement channels into a new zone: "The Unwrangled" for eventual deprecation
    - **Scope**
        - **Plaza**
            - `#announcements`
            - `#introductions`
            - `#coworking-cafe`
            - `#collaboration`
            - `#yak-lounge`
            - `#yak-poop`
        - **Incubator**
            - `#wargames`
            - `#soap-box`
            - `#coffee-with-a-yak`
        - **Projects**
            - `#astonishing-stories`
            - `#empirical-feng-shui`
            - `#new-old-home-and-country`
            - `#reimagine-healthcare`
            - `#yak-rover`
        - **Working Groups**
            - `#infrastructure`
            - `#bots-and-automation`
            - `#production-flow`
            - `#welcome-squad`
            - `#yakathon`
        - **Study Groups**
            - `#online-governance-studies`
            - `#philosophical-studies`
            - `#yak-ethnography-studies`
        - **The Unwrangled**
            - Everything else
            - Temporary destination; either promoted back into an 'active category' or archived
            - Equivalent to the Incubator in purpose for channel deprecation
    - Desired Outcomes::
        - Make it clear that we're not here to just talk, this is primarily a place for doing stuff
        - Cohere around a legible set of 'engagements' for Yaks to make onboarding easier
        - See increased engagement on the premise that conversation stokes conversation
- **Second Proposal -- Navigation**
    - **Problem:**
        - There's no way for Yaks to onboard themselves e.g. walking through open gates
        - There's no way to opt-out or opt-in to the activities we want to participate in
    - Solution::
        - Control channel visibility using 'roles' that can be mediated in the same way 'project subscriptions' are currently managed
        - Extension of [[Nathan Acks' March 2021 Discord Channel Organization Change Proposal]]
    - **Scope:**
        - Visible to `@everyone`
            - `#announcements`
            - `#introductions`
        - Visible to `@yak`
            - Rest of Plaza
            - Incubator
            - Unwrangled
            - Voice Channels
            - Dashboard
        - Visible to `@roles`
            - Projects
            - Working Groups
            - Study Groups
    - **Desired Outcomes:**
        - Open boundaries will create a liminal threshold and the sense of in-group identity; quests
        - Higher engagement because people will be 'buying-in' to the roles they're interested in
        - Interactive functionality leads to greater engagement with the infrastructure and therefore incentivize further exploration of the infrastructure -- eventually a means to tie together everything we would encourage Yaks to do
- **Third Proposal -- Bots**
    - **Problem:**
        - There's some ambiguity on what kind of behaviors should be modeled
        - Nothing to suggest anyone can do anything in a permissionless environment
        - Requires manual intervention to create/destroy channels leading to friction and overhead
    - **Solution:**
        - Automate the create/destroy channel process by allowing bots to create channels and timeboxing the deprecation of channels into the Unwrangled and eventually archive
    - **Scope:**
        - Bot commands to create channels in the incubator category
        - Bot commands to upgrade channels in the incubator category to project/work/study groups based on the number of emotes that are collected
        - Scan channels for activity on a regular basis to deprecate ghost-towns
        - Connecting the dashboard to the creative/destructive process
    - **Desired Outcomes:**
        - Make it clear YC is a permissionless environment and Yaks can manage themselves
        - Make it clear what kinds of behaviors should be modeled and empower Yaks to do so
        - Ideal workflow -- if a Yak can create, manage, and publish a project in a fairly obvious and easy way without ever speaking to a Yakshaver
