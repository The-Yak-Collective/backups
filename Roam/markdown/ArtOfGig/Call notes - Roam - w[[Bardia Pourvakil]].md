- ### from [[Bardia Pourvakil]]::
    - Very common to share links to Roam pages
        - The preview is garbage
    - Finer grained page-level and block-level permissioning
    - Roam is so slow to load
    - Loading screen tips
    - Anarchic collective
        - Free form organization
        - Laid out the cow path -> now paving the cow path
            - Seeing the limitations of the cow path structure
                - Now we know how things are working we need to formalize it a little bit
    - Roam for publishing?
        - Using Roam as an input for websites
            - Not sure if the Roam interface itself is good for branding / identity perspective
        - Wants to port over content into Roam and use the backups to create the YC website
            - Create a namespace, pull the graph, filter off a namespace, and build parts of the website off of that 
        - How do I keep up with all the new features when publishing?
            - Don't want to duplicate how things are rendered
            - Using the data and generating webpages but reproducing some of the features
    - Want to query the API to get all the pages that live in a certain namespace or with a certain tag
        - Strip out any links pointing out of that and then pull in a complete JSON that describes the thing that can be interpreted into a different structure for displaying
    - Markdown export and dialect is a little eccentric in Roam—would be nicer if they were more standardized
    - Conflicting roam/js / API data (if we want to reproduce the experience from Roam -> external website we may also want what's rendered so we can show that even if it is not part of the Roam data)
    - Wants to ingest a rendered markdown file through the API
    - Add information from other sources onto the Roam display
        - User name -> add onto it information about the user into Roam
            - Have it potentially displayed but maybe not in the Roam
    - Better user management
        - Permissioning based on log-ins from other systems
            - Concept of groups that they can port over
        - Example: keep Roam permissions in sync with Discord roles
    - Library of templates for different use cases
        - Multi-user templates
        - Curated lightly by Roam so it doesn't get messy
        - Roam is the hardware, templates are the software
            - A centralized place I can find them 
    - Make adding a public graph to your graphs automatic (a button)
    - 4 levels of permissioning:
        - Venkat - Admin
            - Gardeners - Editors (can edit anyone's blocks)
                - Yaks - Writers (only add/edit own blocks)
                    - Readers
                        - Anyone can comment but not add blocks
    - - Block editing are all-or-nothing
    - Editing the same block at the same time is not stable
        - Editing has happened to my block but I didn't know!
            - More fine-grained
                - Live cursor and showing diffs
                - Locking blocks while editing?
    - Example Style Guide::

    - API will expose last edit date, last edited by, etc.
    - Toggling comments and pinging people on Discord would be possible using `roam/js`
    - Roam is going to be adding authorized plugins. A few months from now.
    - API is coming soon. API will only work in a new (experimental) graph.
        - New graphs are pretty buggy.
    - Bardia is going to send us Roam's Slack bot.
    - Eventually, Roam wants to move away from `roam/js`.
    - Roam thinks that conventions are best demo'd, not by templates.
        - Demo videos or gifs may be best.
        - Top Roam conventions:
            - Tags (where are they, which tags to include)
    - Jenna wants to create a "gardener cell"
    - Loss-less backup is coming
    - No way to get the graph JSON except running an export
    - Right now Roam loads the entire database on startup; Roam is working to make loading lazy
        - This is a big internal priority
    - API will make the website easier to pull
    - Admin/Editors/Users can be added to a graph, and then we'll get direct access in our graph menu
        - Roam can set it up to make all gardners graph editors; then we can make the graph viewable-only, and gardeners can manually add new yaks. ^^We need to think about this...^^ [[September 27th, 2020]]

- ### from [[Jenna]]::
    - I'm trying to catch topics as they go by, please add others just so we have a record of what we touched on to help others?
    - roam/js by person
    - permissioning in general
    - commenting set up
    - notifications
    - set up a house style+conventions for Roam gardeners
        - agree on consistent tags eg for zettling
        - set up a Gardeners Cell
        - permissive for general yaks 
        - + an agreement that Gardeners can come around and garden
    - a proper unfurl
    - risk of vandalism
        - eg our public directory in Roam (currently deprecated)
    - block-level linking? yes, if you zoom in
    - load times lol » they are working on an initial partial load implementation
    - paving the cow paths v. top-down planning on Yak structures
    - Roam for public-facing publication » wait to use the API
    - can add folks as editors to the graph » ask Venkat
    - permissioning idea: viewers « users « gardeners « owner
