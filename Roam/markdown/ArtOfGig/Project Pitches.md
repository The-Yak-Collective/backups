- **CURRENT PROCESS:** To start a project now, just go to the #general-discussions channel on the Discord and start a conversation about it! When you've identified a couple of potential co-conspirators, just start a page and get going by any means necessary. Talk to [[Venkatesh Rao]] for help structuring things. Then add it to the [[Projects Directory]]
- About:: Main directory page for continuous project pitching and tracking. 
- Chief Page Wrangler:: [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Additional page wranglers: Looking for people
- Notes::
    - See also: [[Production Squad]] page maintained by [[Jenna Dixon]] for production support that will be available, and the [[Yak Collective Fund]] to see how much financial support is currently available.
    - Unlike the old proposals [[Greenlighting Process]] (now deprecated), which had both a Roam page component and a google forms component, which was used for the first two cycles (May and July 2020), this process will solely be based on Roam, Discord, and automated/semi-automated activities triggered on github and the website.
- **DEPRECATED OLD PROPOSAL PROCESS CONTENT**: Everything in this section is deprecated and retained here only to provide historical context.
    - TO PROPOSE A PROJECT::
        - Copy the metadata template block below for **Sample Project**, paste it at the TOP of the **Projects List** section just below it, and populate it.  The __%% italicized text__ is help-comments you can **delete. At minimum, you will need to have identified a backup lead name before the proposal is considered "proposed", otherwise it is draft.**
            - [[Sample Project]]: Brief 1-2 sentence pitch/blurb.
        - Populate the project's own page as you see fit.
        - Propose a Discord channel, share your project's page in it once it is created, and invite people to join the channel as either potential participants or interested supporters/watchers. You may have to go actively recruiting.
        - Show up at a [[Yak Collective Governance]] chat (Friday mornings 9 AM Pacific) to live-pitch your project informally to people. We'll be starting a section of the chat for that. 
        - If you decide you have critical mass by your launch date, your project status will shift to **Started** and things may start to automatically happen, like a page appearing on the website, an announcement in the newsletter etc.
    - [[Sample Project]]: Brief 1-2 sentence pitch/blurb.
        -  %% __Project name should be a short phrase that should link to a detail page which you are free to structure as you see fit (click sample project page link for ideas).

        - [[Boutiques vs Marketplaces Wargames]] Emergent boutiques and emergent marketplaces may be similar in size (pretty small), but they are essentially completely different organizations -- with different goals, different structures and different business models. 
In this project we want to explore this difference on a very practical level. We will try to design both business models and organizations for a very specific segment -- professional services -- and put them to test via wargames__.

            - **Comments** Right now the idea space in terms of fixing US healthcare for gig workers is essentially Aspen Institute "portable benefits" programs which really don't solve the problem they claim to solve or California "turn everyone into full-time employees" fixes that are stuck in the 20th century rather than any real attempt at trying to find something that works.
