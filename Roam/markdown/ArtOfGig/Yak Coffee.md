- **tl;dr: Book a free call with a few Yaks about something you saw/heard that might lead to longer and paid conversations.**

- **Contributors so far:**
    - [[Phil Wolff]]
- **The Problem: **: [[Marketing]]
    - How do we convert interest in Yak ideas into a consulting gig? 
A conversation. 
How to turn interest into positive press and reputation? 
Many conversations.  
- **This project will let us test these assumptions** about YakC and consulting:
    - Intake-calls work with more than one person taking the call

    - Herds (small groups of Yaks) are a viable unit of organizing

    - Free calls lead to enough paid engagement 
    - Yaks want YakC to serve (in part) as a bizdev channel for folks who dislike or are newbies at or are bad at bizdev

    - Yaks can discover trustworthy colleagues within our community
    - Yaks will try a platform offering services comparable to fiverr (gig productization), Patreon (subscription models), and a design portfolio service.
    - Inbound marketing can substitute substantially for direct marketing and networking and word of mouth.
    - YakC can do the business of organizing coffees and the business side of things.  
- **A Yak Coffee is a 20 minute, free, virtual call between YC consultants with a stranger.** 
    - potential client, the press, referrers, potential Yaks. 
- **The Yak Collective Café is the venue for discovering and booking Coffee calls**
    - [[Yak Collective Café]] 
- **Stakeholder views. **
    - A. From the Client's perspective: 
        - Consultation Goals: Have a productive get-acquainted call (am I really interested?), maybe even learn something
        - Steps: 
            - Discover YakC
            - Discover a Herd 
                - Perhaps you visit the [[Yak Collective Café]] 
                - A herd is a list of yaks who consult together 
                    - about a common problem or theme 
                    - using a common or connected set of practices
            - Schedule a call
                - Think "calend.ly pro" or other quick booking solution
                - Include request for client to answer up to three questions before the call 
            - Confirmation 
                - Email confirmations and invitation to share pre-call reading material and profile links
                - appointment added to your calendar, and 
                - pre-call reminders via SMS
            - Call
                - One person introduces the team in one minute
                - Q. Orienting question: By the end of this call...? Today's big question is...? You'll know your time was well spent if...? 
            - Structured follow-up 
                - Thanks. Link to the Herd's page. 
        - Effort: 4 minutes to find and schedule. 2 minutes to read the follow-up invite. 
        - Price: FREE

        - Risks: low, just time and embarrassment, perhaps social engineering, fear of strangers.
    - B. From YakC's overall perspective:
        - Community. Promote conversation and connections among Yaks
        - Commerce. Lower friction for Yaks to solicit business 
        - Velocity. Increase surface area for PL collaboration and discovery
        - Craft. Yaks get collectively better at shaping offers and closing for projects

    - C. From a Yak's perspective:
        - Goals: build peer and client network, turn conversations into leads, make this part of your sales funnel
        - Experience

                - Talk in your Herd about common project scope, the language you use, the size and scale, and how projects like this might work.
                - Talk in your Herd about powerful and audacious Coffee offers. Why are you worth the distinctive premium your clients will gladly pay?
