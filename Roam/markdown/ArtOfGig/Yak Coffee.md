    - **The Problem: **: [[Marketing]]
        - How do we convert interest in Yak ideas into a consulting gig? 
A conversation. 
How to turn interest into positive press and reputation? 
Many conversations.  
    - **This project will let us test these assumptions** about YakC and consulting:
        - Intake-calls work with more than one person taking the call

        - Herds (small groups of Yaks) are a viable unit of organizing

        - Free calls lead to enough paid engagement 
        - Yaks want YakC to serve (in part) as a bizdev channel for folks who dislike or are newbies at or are bad at bizdev

        - Yaks can discover trustworthy colleagues within our community
        - Yaks will try a platform offering services comparable to fiverr (gig productization), Patreon (subscription models), and a design portfolio service.
        - Inbound marketing can substitute substantially for direct marketing and networking and word of mouth.
        - YakC can do the business of organizing coffees and the business side of things.  
    - **A Yak Coffee is a 20 minute, free, virtual call between YC consultants with a stranger.** 
        - potential client, the press, referrers, potential Yaks. 
    - **The Yak Collective Café is the venue for discovering and booking Coffee calls**

- # Design
    - ## Stakeholder views. **
        - A. From the Client's perspective: 
            - Consultation Goals: Have a productive get-acquainted call (am I really interested?), maybe even learn something
            - Steps: 
                - Discover YakC
                - Discover a Herd 
                    - Perhaps you visit the [[Yak Collective Café]] 
                    - A herd is a list of yaks who consult together 
                        - about a common problem or theme 
                        - using a common or connected set of practices
                - Schedule a call
                    - Think "calend.ly pro" or other quick booking solution
                    - Include request for client to answer up to three questions before the call 
                - Confirmation 
                    - Email confirmations and invitation to share pre-call reading material and profile links
                    - appointment added to your calendar, and 
                    - pre-call reminders via SMS
                - Call
                    - One person introduces the team in one minute
                    - Q. Orienting question: By the end of this call...? Today's big question is...? You'll know your time was well spent if...? 
                - Structured follow-up 
                    - Thanks. Link to the Herd's page. 
            - Effort: 4 minutes to find and schedule. 2 minutes to read the follow-up invite. 
            - Price: FREE

            - Risks: low, just time and embarrassment, perhaps social engineering, fear of strangers.
        - B. From YakC's overall perspective:
            - Community. Promote conversation and connections among Yaks
            - Commerce. Lower friction for Yaks to solicit business 
            - Velocity. Increase surface area for PL collaboration and discovery
            - Craft. Yaks get collectively better at shaping offers and closing for projects

        - C. From a Yak's perspective:
            - Goals: build peer and client network, turn conversations into leads, make this part of your sales funnel
            - Experience
                - Discover the [[Yak Collective Café]] service
                    - Internal campaigns to get Yaks to sign up 
                - Build your personal profile (minimums?)
                - Herd up into a small team that will gig together
                    - Find an existing herd and ask to join 
                    - Invite others to join your herd
                - Herd Talk
                    - Talk with your Herd about roles in coffee chats (facilitator, scribe, closer, etc) and coffee goals. Intent: being relaxed/professional with each other during a coffee. 
                    - Talk in your Herd about common project scope, the language you use, the size and scale, and how projects like this might work.
                    - Talk in your Herd about powerful and audacious Coffee offers. Why are you worth the distinctive premium your clients will gladly pay? 

                - Complete your Herd profile
                    - Name, membership
                    - Time zones served

- # **Discussion**
    - [[Grigori Milov]]: How do you trust your fellow Yaks? No vetting, no shared experience with clients. How do you split the work and revenue? Who's in charge? There is great opportunity for conflict and for damaged reputation.
