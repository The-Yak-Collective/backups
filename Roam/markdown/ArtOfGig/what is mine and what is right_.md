- from noble house re the tai-pan:
    - 'First: There shall be only one tai-pan at one time and he hath total, absolute authority over the Company, power to employ or remove from employment all others, authority over all our captains and our ships and companies wherever they may be. The tai-pan is always alone, that being the joy and the hurt of it. His privacy must be guarded by all and his back protected by all. Whatsoever he orders, it shall be obeyed, and no committees or courts or inner circles shall ever be formed or allowed in the Company to curb this absolute power.
- and
    - "Of course. But Struan's is very different from us. We own things and companies—they're percentagers. They've little more than a 5 percent holding in most of their subsidiaries yet they still exercise absolute control by special voting shares, or by making it mandatory in the Articles of Association that their tai-pan's also tai-pan of the subsidiary with overriding say."

        - Another highly recommended read from this week. The following outlines the initiatives of the Etheruem Foundation, their spend, treasury and what they’re focusing in on. A report like this has never really been released by the foundation so it was great reading it as an outsider. One thing that caught my interest was that they have $300m of non-crypto assets. I was wondering what those assets are and in what legal entity they’re housed in and who controls that. Questions for another day I guess.
