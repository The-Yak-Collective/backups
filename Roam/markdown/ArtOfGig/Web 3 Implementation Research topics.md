- ^^[[Nathan Acks]]: I’ll put something together about hosting options. Might take me a couple of weeks though, as I also need to put together my part of the [[YC Annual Meeting 2021]]. Lots of sub-points, might not get to all of them.^^ Options for integrating website dynamic content into blockchains? #[[Nathan Acks]]
    - When is this appropriate? #[[Nathan Acks]]
    - [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [Arweave](https://arweave.org/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), other storage solutions?

- Culture war between Bitcoin and Ethereum and practical implications

    - The Hic Et Nunc project on the Tezos Chain is in a current "Culture war". HEN is an open source NFT marketplace built on the Tezos chain by a Brazilian developer. NFTs minted on HEN are called OBJKT. The developer "discontinued" the project after a site called objct.com announced their own minting feature (using their own smart contract and not HEN's). HEN is an open source project, so several clones were made and members of the community resurrected the project. However, several other people not a part of the original community have since taken advantage of this market volatility and open source framework to appropriate the technology and marketplace into what the original community is framing as an act of global north hegemony. This global south/north tension might be an interesting and current case study of chain/culture wars. #[[Commits Vortex]]
    - Jargon: "The Flippening" (speculative future event when Ethereum's market cap might surpass Bitcoin's)
- Social
    - Since blockchain activity is irreversible, will individuals just spin up new identities to get away from their past? 
        - or be less involved /mf
        - or be able to evolve (not the same as a fork, as it is more gradual) /mf
    - Can someone with no blockchain history be trusted? In the real world, communities are suspicious of outsiders.
    - Could someone manufacture blockchain history as a way to seed a new identity? Also, what does __blockchain history__ really entail?
    - Identity swapping - nothing prevents people from hopping across identities, is this a problem? Thinking about the "sleeves" and "stacks" from Altered Carbon.

        - especially - how do we forgive (also forget?) mistakes, if yc is supposed to be a safe place, we want reputational price for mistakes to be low /mf
    - When delegating, how does a group keep people informed? Current DAOs are centered around Discord and Twitter, which are very ephemeral, and hard to keep track of. Do DAOs adopt corporate reporting practices? At what point is a DAO just a corporation?
    - some of this goes under "safety" and perhaps - how to keep the dao beast from escaping its human masters /mf
    - What are the pros and cons of an open-sourced organization, where all activity is public? This visibly backfired on ConstitutionDAO, as the winner of that auction knew exactly how much they needed to bid to win.
