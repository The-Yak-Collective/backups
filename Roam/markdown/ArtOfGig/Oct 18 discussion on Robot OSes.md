- State of the art
    - Things like “subsumption architecture” are vague philosophies, not OSes
    - NASA etc. use bespoke things like Plexil (see [Eric’s Feb 8 discussion](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/02-08-2021))
    - ROS1 really isn’t an OS at all, let alone an RTOS, it’s pub-sub middleware to handle the sideshow stuff (see Victor’s [Feb 22 session](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/DmVR1bbBK) and [Rhett’s Aug 12](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/s3CM2U-FE) session)
    - ROS2 appears to try a little… but
    - There have been serious attempts like [Microsoft’s CCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_and_Coordination_Runtime) (concurrency and coordination run time, abandoned in 2012)
    - State of the art sucks… probably because computer scientists working top-down rather than roboticists working bottom up
    - SO…. everybody ends up re-implementing vision, mobility, SLAM… over and over again.
- Desiderata
    - Start bottom-up from demands of REAL TIME, REAL SPACE, REAL MATTER
    - Situatedness is a FIRST CLASS concept
    - Embodiment is a FIRST CLASS concept
    - Brains NONDUALISTICALLY reflect their bodies; No disembodied AIs
    - A Robot OS must be ADAPTED to a SPECIFIC RANGE of bodies
    - A Robot OS must support [Software 2.0](https://vimeo.com/274274744) as the __primary __programming paradigm
    - A Robot OS must balance ESSENTIAL identity and SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED identities (via entanglement with other robots, humans)
    - Robot coordination/control languages must be interoperable with human
    - Robots must embody survival/evolution/mortality and exploration/exploitation at core
    - Robots must be able to think at “Asimov Three Laws” level
- Some implications
    - Yak OS must work BETTER in rover robots and WORSE in other kinds of robots

- Ideas we've already discussed
    - Rovers must do abductive reasoning (Eric)
    - Rovers must exist in a containerized VPNized “society” (Victor)
    - Rovers must be able to “borrow” and “lend” capabilities (Maier)
    - Rovers must model the environment in terms of affordances (Anuraj)
    - Rovers must be able to scavenge (Venkat)
    - Rovers must have a “language” of representation/understanding (Rhett)
    - …Obviously lots more to come
    - But need a techno-philosophical True North first!
