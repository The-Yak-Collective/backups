- Created as a broadening of the [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]. The Distributed Systems Study Group has a broader scope, and covers:
    - Distributed computing (technical)
        - Including Blockchain technologies
    - Distributed computing (social)
    - Distributed systems generally (including swarms in nature etc)
- The goal is to have a track complementary to the [[Governance Studies]] track, with a more technological focus.
- We aim to create a [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] as our work product over the summer
- There is interest in creating a prompt-school type track around this, and we will be trialing this over the summer.

                                    - think human-based systems have a more viable option of reach-through from one hierarchy level to another. the ones we care about are dynamic to , like a flock of birds, so the leader (of which there can be many at once) take turns at different effective places in hierarchy. in his words - i think the systems we care about are not near decomposable as he suggests most social systems are.
                                    - __one cannot, for example, enact the role of "friend" with large numbers of other people.__
                                    - it seems like the focus on hierarchy detracts from analyzing the  links between components.

                        - The user experience on Discord is cluttered
                        - Good to have visibility of reading lists
                        - Difficult to track messages. If you are not embedded in the community then it difficult to jump into something
                    - [[Grigori Milov]]

                    - [[Maier Fenster]]
                        - we have more hopes than people to do the stuff
                        - we need people not only who build it but also people who use it in addition to people who would improve it
                        - the infra part needs traction either from user side or builder side
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                        - Reason for mismatch between hopes and execution could be because there it is distributed volunteer based product
                        - New user onboarding is lacking at the moment. Difficult for them get in the community. How to onboard outsiders? 
                        - YC is between public space and private space

            - Prompt - What did find interesting in the paper? 
            - Discussion
                - [[Anuraj R]] - timestamps for sync? trivial method?
                - [[Ben Mahala]] - seeds of byzantine fault tolerance
                    - all nodes communicate first, and if they contacted every node 
                    - all the things that start from here and flow into the current systems
                    - if there is a crash in one node it takes down all systems, but this has been solved in today's systems
                - [[Grigori Milov]]
                    - in the middle of article the usefullness of order of events is questioned
                    - play it local, maybe a more recent article on syncing in distributed system would give a better view
                    - what ever happends on global system does not matter until locally processed, local times scale more important? 
                - [[Nathan Acks]]
                    - pick pockets, how they fake sensation of things on the body
                    - [[Commits Vortex]]
                        - hand illusion, rubber hand after partition in a table, people feel illusion on the rubber hand even though it is not their real hand
                    - a lot of what the brain is doing is anticipating the events,  
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - new advances in databases 10 years ago - spanner system, that line of research began in this paper
                    - Paxos - first reading of the summer
                    - this is works under 
                    - the non trivialiality can be appreciated one the lack of data is known, that is a central time keeping
                    - distributed system is unnatural, eg is blind and there is baton/ball to pass on another person, how to pass the ball so that everyone gets to play with the ball
                    - trade off central time keeping and message verbosity(everyone talks to everyone)
                    - byzantine fault tolerance increase the complexity of this problem
                    - relation to physics and space-time is fascinating

                    - member rights, user rights
                    - social software: need to understand social context (take advantage of it and be ready for the emergent challenges) and design for the social patterns as much as technological affordances

            - Discussion
                - [[Nathan Acks]] - trade off between optimal and robust solution in applied maths
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] - dealt with issue in almost everything touched
                    - who gets to decide is the real question, pick two - fast, efficient, cheap
                - [[Grigori Milov]] - easy to find examples
                    - good distinction between individual and collective decisions
                    - in some orgs decisions are made collectively, while in others decisions individually while execution collectively
                - [[Ben Mahala]] - frontier defined by this is technology dependent, a new tech can help in getting more efficiency
                    - lot of orgs tend to be dishonest about actual place on the trade-offs
                    - lot of entities in principle have to follow thouroughness but don't 
                    - chemical safety board youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/USCSB/videos
                    - if there is a possibility of catatrophe then it can be spread 
                    - thouroughness and efficiency both take effort 
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - Noah Sussman called it CAP theorem for humans
                    - ETTO at the org level ends being bureucracy vs private sector tradeoff
                    - can see the same things in accounting, policing, eg of where one leans to thouroughness it leans to bureucracy 
                    - DAO vs traditional startup companies
                    - decentraliced tech leans towards thourougness and centralized leans towards efficiency
                    - one way to complete CAP theorem in humans 
                        - accountability(power differential -Ben's suggestion), thourouhness, efficiency
                - Open Floor
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] - our perceptions of ourselves tend to be not correct to reality
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] - we all end up on the spectrum somewhere, some funkies who tend to live up to the standard set up by the person in power
                    - [[Ben Mahala]] - in decentralized systems these sort of dishonesty is difficult to do. in a group when everyone is a peer it is difficult to do. can't loosen rules locally without loosening it globally
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - eg multi-sig gnosis safe
                        - meta lesson with YakCollective - of all the experiments thoroughness experiments succeed more often then efficiency experiments

                    - decentralized structures are not getting destroyed by external powers
                    - difficult to run such structures without some people doing the centralizing work
                    - when times are bad there is strong incentive is make it centralized

                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
            - notes::
                - [[Ananth]] notes that civility is important for the smooth functioning of much of society. US road signs seem to embody certain aspects of the US culture, and the __constraint__ dimension of this culture are actually quite important.
                - [[Anuraj R]] (in chat) counters that the US/India comparison may be apples/oranges.
                - [[Ben Mahala]] notes that traffic __is__ a microcosm of society. But one important thing to keep in mind is that US roads are much more heavily policed than in many other countries. This enables traffic to flow more smoothly, but there __is__ an advantage to slower, more chaotic traffic: It __may__ enforce more situational awareness and lower speeds, which may in turn lead to a __safer__ traffic situation. Simple, embodied, rules seem good. It's not clear how much the driving example generalizes to politics, however. Driving is a more cooperative(ish) game than politics.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] (in chat) notes that Indian traffic fatality rates are actually higher than in the US ([1](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1084613012272451604/1084859658176573581), [2](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1084613012272451604/1084859733778899055)).
                - [[Grigori Milov]] found the article biased and rhetorically weak. This even comes out in the pictures: The US example photo shows __many__ fewer cares than the Indian picture. A US street with as many cars as the example Indian street would probably need some sort of manual intervention (police) to function. The article was also very data-light. Also, are stop signs really necessary? Maybe all that's necessary is a rule about how to function at an intersection.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] thought that the article's three-point summary was actually quite good. In Maine, there's a lot of snowmobile accidents, partly because the rules of the road (hand signals, in the case of snowmobiles) aren't as well established.
                - [[Shreeda Segan]] found the article's __structure__ annoying (it's very TED Talk-ish), but thinks that __is__ on to something: It's remarkable how many __different__ kinds of neurotypes can cooperate in driving (because of the simple rules?). It would be interesting to see how __sticky__ traffic norms are culturally. What is the history here? What does social enforcement look like? How do norms and rules interact to enforce/weaken each other? (For example, someone not turning on green is likely to get honked at. But someone just moving too slowly in the left lane will just get passed on the right.)
                - [[Steven Chung]] remembers an article they ran into about roundabouts being more efficient than stop signs. Do stop signs allow for greater traffic density? Are they more efficient?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] (in chat) notes that roundabouts are indeed more efficient than four-way stops.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] notes that there were two big changes they encountered when re-learning how to drive after moving from India to the US: Driving on the other side of the road, and the sheer __speed__ at which traffic moves in the US. Like, US traffic can move at a truly terrifying rate compared to elsewhere in the world. One important thing to remember is that when traffic gets chaotic, people avoid it. This leads to a bit of a tragedy of the commons in India w.r.t. traffic: Only the bravest people travel in the densest, most chaotic areas, and those people tend to choose more maneuverable modes of transit that can actually make congestion __worse__ (even if the individual drivers can navigate more effectively). Chaotic traffic situations, even slow ones, __are__ truly dangerous. Clear, enforced rules allow more people to participate in those systems; this is not just about how well the system works, but also the sheer psychological stress that chaotic situations can induce in their participants. That said, it's likely that near optimal outcomes will appear quite chaotic, especially in higher dimensional spaces.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that one reason traffic rules may work is because people in the US are actually abnormally cooperative. Having simple, explicit rules may help with this: Even if simple rules aren't as efficient as a more complex ruleset, you can get greater social buy-in with them, because people are better able to understand __how__ they fit into the system and __what__ is expected from them (and what they can in turn expect).
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] agrees that Americans really do appear to be abnormally cooperative. They like to work together. Even de Tocqueville observed this. India can sometimes be the reverse though: On the surface very cooperative, but very "out for number one" when push comes to shove. Interestingly, even foreigners will switch out these cooperative norms on a moment's notice. There might be a 2x2 here: Order vs. chaos on one axis and deep vs. superficial cooperation on the other.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] observes that some homeless folks in South Africa were providing __ad hoc__ traffic signaling services during some recent large-scale power outages. There's a good question here about how __strongly__ rules/norms should be enforced. When is it okay for a norm to be (soft) broken? BBC From Our Own Correspondent:

            - notes::
                - [[Steven Chung]] thought that the blog post was perhaps overly-optimistic, and that the loop would require more iterations and fine-tuning than Webb's examples. That said, the code so far __does__ look really simple. The applications to writing code are interesting.
                - [[Ananth]] finds LangChain really interesting, and thinks that article does a good job of both describing the uses of this framework and the more general ReAct approach. Robin Sloan's observation that LLMs may become "universal couplers", just generic text over TCP, seems right. One thing that this approach might help with is the conversion of the physical domain into the simulation domain; doing this is kind of a dark art right now, and an AI-in-the-loop approach might make this a lot faster/easier. That said, Ananth felt that the examples were somewhat trivial, and the leap to "the Singularity is nigh!" was not really supported. But the applications are really interesting.
                - [[Anuraj R]] also found the end of the article ("the Singularity is nigh!") was annoying. The ReAct loop has some similarities to current programming paradigms. Anuraj has been using ChatGPT as a kind of "interactive Stack Overflow".
                    - [[Steven Chung]] has also been using ChatGPT similarly.
                - [[Commits Vortex]] is in listen-only mode...
                - [[Grigori Milov]] thinks that the ReAct framework is already something that disciplined human thinking uses. So LLMs helping us do this faster seems like a no-brainer. AI systems still seem to be weak at __real__ observation right now; people don't base their thinking on a single observation, but rather experiments and life experience that contain __many__ data points we draw inferences from. Figuring out when a data point is "bullshit" is hard, and right now AI doesn't seem to have a good way of building out a "bullshit detector" for the data it ingests. How to teach a machine intuition? Also, "the Singularity is nigh" was annoying to Grigori as well. As a counter-example, consider chess: The best machines can beat the best humans, but not by much of a margin. Even this domain-specific brute-forcing approach only gives a computer a __little__ bit of an edge. And chess is very simple compared to the real world. Machines might be better than us, but not that much better. So a little bit of hope there.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that there's a never-ending difficulty "managing underlings". Virtual assistants have some of the same scoping problems. The best use of delegation is simple, "dumb" tasks that are maybe hard to code explicitly, but so simple we don't want to do them ourselves. Jenna wonders when the process described in the article will become simple enough to be broadly accessible. Jenna is reminded of a book that had a smart agent like this, that would go off and study interesting questions and then discuss the results, which would be an interesting interface paradigm.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] is in listen-only mode...
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that, based on this article and their own experiences, this sort of loop is a good idea. Shorter, focused prompts with a subsequent human response seems to work well. Like Jenna, Venkat isn't looking forward to a future where we have to manage smart, enthusiastic, and mistake-prone virtual assistants. The best managerial roles are more partnerships where you're in continuous, informal interaction with competent, experienced peers. AIs seems to be a long way from this, but an approach like this may be promising.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that, to make a __Star Trek__ analogy, everyone thinks we're building Data, and really what we're building here is the ship's computer (which none of the crew members would ever mistake as anything other than a tool). Also, there's some real non-code limits to how fast an AI can iterate itself. LLMs are not just code, but also weighted models based on huge data sets. This data has to come from somewhere, and will take time to process (even if the code to do that processing, or then run inferences on that data set, can be improved on). Also, ChatGPT and its ilk are __very__ expensive from a hardware perspective, and improvements in GPUs, etc. are much harder to come by than improvements in code.
                - [[Anuraj R]] agrees that the hardware aspects of AI are hard to iterate on.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that there's a proposal on the server to share prompt recipes. This could be interesting/fun. Jenna wants a simple, obvious toggle for these systems that switches them between "things I know" and "things I don't know". Basically, what data source is the AI drawing from.

                - We're going to look into AI (or just automated) transcription / note-taking! That would be handy...
                    - doing a test recording with #[[MEE6]], to pass to otter.ai, possibly to set up a zap or similar #[[jrd]]
                - [[Bryan King]] observes that all of the LLMs seem to be "deep generalists", but often function in a very surface level, like a particular kinda of Twitter personality. So to Bryan, these models feel very close to human-level. But human-level intelligence may not be the bottle neck for making things happen. AI feels like a "so what?" moment; Bryan really struggles to find a use for the current crop of AI tools. It might be useful as a one-off thing, but is it really useful for big projects? Do AIs produce maintainable systems?
                - [[Grigori Milov]] agrees with the papers authors that "intelligence" is a slippery concept. It can kind of be anything; almost any one-dimensional definition breaks down, and multi-dimensional definitions become a kind of "I'll know it when I see it" problem. A lot of the discussion right now is thus retrospective: Rather than coming up with forward-looking tests and definitions, people are asking how well it can perform already-defined tasks. How much of GPT-4's performance is just memorization? Grigori thinks the key here is the concept of __mastery__, which suggests that the questions the authors are asking are the wrong ones. How could we learn from a future iteration of this AI? This may require us to learn how to be "interesting" to the LLM...
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] is in listen-only mode today.
                - [[Kyle Mathews]] has been playing around a lot with LLMs in the last year. It's pretty hit-or-miss right now; the reliability just isn't there, though it __is__ useful when asking questions that are normally swamped by spam in search. For programming, ChatGPT requires __a lot__ of review. GitHub's CoPilot seems more useful. OpenAI's plugin architecture looks like a real game-changer.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] has been working on a presentation about how generative AI will impact IP law. Maier sees it as kind of the opposite of the internet; AI is about zeitgeist, while the internet is about specifics. GPT-4 is __very__ good at generating and processing words; this seems like something patent attorneys might use to describe a new invention. ChatGPT as an "explanation engine" seems like it will be a big deal. It seems like __generating__ text is going to become easier, but __understanding__ text (in particular, sorting signal from noise __within__ a document) is going to be harder. ChatGPT is already good enough to write a bad patent.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] sees GPT-4 as a symbolic manipulator, and is interested in automation.
                - [[Steven Chung]] is in listen-only mode.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that this paper actually defines the concept of "general" more reasonably, as "human equivalence". There's a central question here of whether __humans__ are actually "general intelligences", or just __more__ general than other species on Earth. Certainly GPT-4 is __much__ more general than previous LLMs, but it still experiences __a lot__ of hallucinations and still goes on a lot of tangents. Processing the output of GPT-4 seems to be roughly as hard as processing interactions with "the real world". Calculators meaningfully reduce how "smart" people need to be: Now we don't need to know arithmetic (beyond the basic symbols and logic). But GPT-4 doesn't provide this sort of affordance; for example, if you ask for an essay, you still have to edit the whole thing. And editing is often harder than creating. So we're not really meaningfully __reducing__ the amount of intelligence required of humans, and in fact may be __increasing__ the requirements (debugging/editing/etc. is hard!). What happens when people begin using LLMs to substitute for things like StackOverflow? The only way to get around this loss may be to have the model train itself from its own users' __inputs__. But how do you get out of corner cases, where there are few, if any examples to train the AI but the task is meaningfully human-complex?
                - [[Ananth]] thinks the mathematical reasoning portion of the paper was particularly interesting. The fact that GPT-4 breaks so easily when doing mathematics is potentially telling. But it __is__ good at sketching out answers that require cross-disciplinary knowledge, and it also seems good at Fermi Estimation. Ananth is skeptical that GPT-4 is really "general" yet; non-linear thinking and working memory seem to be real problems. The models __are__ surprisingly creative, and seems to be reasonably good at working within constraints.

                - > How will the evolutionary competition between a massively multiplayer shared second brain and more individual experiences play out? — [Venkatesh Rao, April 10 @ 09:01](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1094986765896519710/1095000630206136521)
            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Nathan Acks]] is a little bit doubtful of the overall value of “multiplayer” experiences. While Noosphere is interesting, it’s not clear that it’s enough to make multiplayer compelling. There’s also the question of how to get people to use it: Is Noosphere really compelling enough for “ordinary folk” to start using. And can it be made simple enough? (As an aside, the Same-Origin Policy seems to be a frequent villain in proposals like this, but it solves a very real problem where the internet is full of bad actors trying to run malicious code to access data via ordinary users. The Same-Origin Policy __does__ encourage centralization, but if you’re going to throw it out then you need to wrestle with the security issues it was designed to mitigate, and nobody seems to really do that.)
                - [[Nai-Chi]] thinks that whether open source multiplayer web-like hyperobjects happen is going to strongly depend on the attention landscape, and how much “press” new media gets on old media. Maintenance is also a problem; without maintenance, both software and content tend to rapidly degrade. How easy can maintenance become for “ordinary folk”? How much can we get “ordinary folk” even __interested__ in maintenance?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] notes that the Noosphere proposal is more __static__ than dynamic; it seems to be a catalogue of __thoughts__, rather than a tool for __thinking__. There’s no sense of automatic processing or updating of content, so the maintenance problem raises its head again. Also, there’s no sense of scale in this proposal... What’s the right scale of multiplayer groups? And what about discovery here? How do people find other graph content to interact with at all?
                - [[Grigori Milov]] is skeptical about what this problem is actually trying to solve; the proposal seems to try too hard to be general. A better approach might be to start with the “second brain” concept at the __individual__ level, and then add more and more sophisticated methods of sharing, rather than trying to jump right to a maximally decentralized end product. Grigori also worries about the __information__ trust issues within Noosphere content; this is already a big problem on the World Wide Web, and is likely to be an even bigger problem in a __less__ centralized system.
                - [[Ananth]] is likewise skeptical (there’s an emerging theme here). Like previous speakers, Ananth doesn’t see how a new protocol will be able to catch on without an associated application. As for the prompt, Ananth doesn’t think there’s a tension between individual and multiplayer experiences. Most apps already require people to produce content for each other. The future is probably in finding ways to __tailor__ individual experiences within a multiplayer context, rather than iterating between multiplayer and individual experiences.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] agrees with Maier that Noosphere is trying to solve multiple problems: **(1)** how to decentralize a centralized process, and **(2)** how do you identify trusted data on the internet? For the latter problem, the solution seems to be to combine the social (trust) graph and the interest graph. These __are__ different things, and need to be tracked __somewhat__ separately... But they’re also deeply entangled. The best way we have to do this right now is to continuously talk to people, but the Noosphere proposal replaces this with key-based trust (either CID hashes for content or individual private keys for individuals). These two layers are probably sufficient to create entangled social/interest graphs; IPFS and Spheres enable content and keys / address books to be portable. Overall, Venkat thinks collective authorship is pretty inevitable, and some proposal like this will probably be an important part of making this happen. NFTs may be an important part of gating Noosphere content.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that Farcaster might provide an interesting notification and discovery channel for Noosphere; the two projects seem complimentary in that way. And perhaps the Same-Origin Policy could be replaced with CID or private key based trust? Unfortunately, trusting __both__ CIDs and private keys probably leads to too many edge cases, and Nathan suspects that ultimately trust would become centralized in keys (individuals) rather than content.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wonders what problem this solves.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] agrees somewhat. Noosphere __does__ solve a set of problems, but it’s not clear that it really solves them in a way that’s __more__ compelling than the current system, especially considering that all of the content kinda lives in the World Wide Web right now.
                - [[Anuraj R]] wonders how this is is different than Farcaster.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that Noosphere is mostly another step in decentralization.
                - [[Nai-Chi]] observes that something like the Noosphere probably would help with AI training, as it includes both text and the social metadata related to that text.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] sees that more as a hope, rather than something to be excited about. Farcaster solves a problem people have __now__, while Noosphere seems to solve a more theoretical set of problems. Training other people’s AI models doesn’t seem like a winning pitch.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] notes that there are some frustrating trade-offs in current “second brain” tools: practicality and performance vs. ability to interlink. Noosphere seems to be trying to “have its cake and eat it too” in this regard.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] still doesn’t see the excitement here.
                - [[Anuraj R]] notes that you need a critical mass of people to make something interesting. Twitter is falling apart, but it’s still a better social discover tool than Farcaster. And Noosphere doesn’t even really exist.

            - **Meeting Notes**
                - **Gordon Brander’s Opening Remarks**
                    - Brander sees the current “tools for thought” as the resurrection of older ideas at the dawn of hypertext. Subconscious has a couple of aims:
                        - Make sure that people own their own data, and don’t lose access to it if any one application becomes defunct.
                        - Allow for __networked__ thinking between knowledge graphs.
                        - Combine this network of hypertext documents with AI to allow these graphs to “think”.
                - **Discussion**
                    - [[Commits Vortex]] has two questions: (1) How does an AI companion interact with our concept of “death”. (2) How will governance work in the context of Noosphere?
                    - [[Grigori Milov]] finds the idea of AIs that sync with each other immensely problematic. Moreover, does having “two brains” really help us think better, or will the AI become a personal echo chamber?
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] is interested in the protocol. Noosphere seems to solve the problems addressed by the Same-Origin Policy by separating authentication, document storage/retrieval/display, and document creation/update/delete. This seems (superficially) similar to the approach taken by the Gemini Protocol, but using IPFS to ensure distributed availability/backup. Is this the correct way to think about Noosphere? How do private documents (single and shared) work in this context (uploading encrypted blobs?)? For shared documents, is the idea that signing can become a way of building a human-like web of trust within Noosphere (this key posts documents I find safe/knowledgable/etc.)?
                    - [[Steven Chung]] has always had a problem organizing a notebook into a second brain, and is interested in how AI can help __organize__ this output. Isn’t search perhaps a better tool for finding links between documents?
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]] wonders what it will look like to go from Roam to something that’s local first, social, and automated __all at the same time__. Right now, the Yak Collective’s Roam is more of a “shared repository”, rather than “thinking together”. Over time, we’ve actually moved away from Roam a bit, and are using Discord bots more and more. What does this suggest about how we might interact with Subconscious’s AI? Roam is very good about capturing passive connections. In a networked context, shared graphs are likely to require new protocols... How do we get there with __private__ notebooks? Can the AIs in Subconscious talk to each other with some level of trust, independent of human interaction/command?
                    - [[Ananth]] wonders how AI will help augment our memories. How would keeping a running log of our experiences work in practice? At the protocol level, how does Noosphere enable a richer, multiple-application ecosystem?
                    - [[Ben Mahala]] thinks the idea of an AI trained just on a single person is interesting, but isn’t sure that there’s enough data generated by a single person.
                - **Gordon Brander’s Reactions**
                    - Gordon has a broader notion of AI that’s different than the dominant narratives: Most conversations evolve around AIs as “servants” or “gods”, but Gordon’s interested in them as a form of __augmentation__.
                    - Roam is essentially a conversation between yourself and “yourself over time”. Gordon wants to add AI as a third member to this conversation, asking questions and trying to draw ideas out of this conversation.
                    - The idea behind the Noosphere protocol is not to be exciting in itself, but to solve a set of problems that creates a new greenfield (in this case, a network of knowledge graphs).
                    - Ownership is defined in Noosphere around “credible exit”. Security is still handled by drawing boundaries, but the idea is to __not__ draw every boundary around “the server”. What’s broken out from the server is data (IPFS), linking (pet names), and AuthN/AuthZ (UCAN).
                    - Anything you link in your knowledge graph gets copied into your Sphere. So Noosphere is all about forking and versioning. Eventually Spheres will be multisig (so, e2e-encrypted to __multiple__ parties).
                    - Gordon thinks that signing will be used to determine the providence of data (and hence reputation), and is ultimately the solution to AI-generated “misinformation”.
                    - Part of the idea of Subconscious is that people can follow both other people and AIs. Follows get some level of access to your notes, and can start to riff off of them.
                    - Gordon doesn’t think that AIs need to be particularly smart to be effective riffing partners.
                    - Subconscious will initially be mobile-first (and probably iOS-first), with a web-app to follow. The beta will probably launch within the next 6 months.

            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Ben Mahala]] likes this article a lot. The move from email/username to key pairs as identities is good, though key management is still a problem. Another way to slice the web3 space might be between protocols that have “economic finality” (blockchains) vs. those that don’t (Farcaster, Bluesky). To a certain extent, owning your own key pair largely negates the __technical__ need for DNS. Sybil attacks are a problem in social media; people generally try to solve this by enforcing real-world identity, but Ben thinks that enforcing payments in some way (maybe at a group level) is probably the right solution.
                - [[Grigori Milov]] notes that once content is published, it’s really out of the creator’s control: People screenshot and record things with abandon these days. Perhaps the focus on the content creator isn’t the right one? The right focus may be on how content is controlled __after__ it is published.
                - [[Jordan Peacock]] finds this article interesting from a general perspective. What does an economy based on “web3” systems look like?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wonders why I need __authority__ to create content. The issue isn’t about content __creation__, but rather about how __discoverable__ that content is to others. Is cryptography really necessary to ensure discoverability? And is a self-certifying protocol really important here?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] think that “permissionless protocol” may be an important, missing piece of this conception. It’s possible to construct a “web3” protocol like Jay describes that’s still controlled by a single organization and set of servers (a lot of corporate blockchains look like this). One of the lessons of Web 2.0 is that it’s less about the specifics of the software, and more about data portability __and__ interoperability. “User-generated authority enabled by self-certifying web protocols” gets us the first of these, but “permissionless protocols” are what get us the second. (Content addressing are a __necessary__ part of “permissionless protocols”, but are not in and of themselves __sufficient__.)
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that identity can be “created” in web3 using a TOFU model with key pairs. Venkat also likes Jay’s model of the hosted/posted/signed web. Signing is somewhere between “execution” and “ownership”. “Ownership” is a powerful cultural attractor, and Venkat isn’t sure that this middle ground is stable. It might be good enough for more “hive mind” like groups. Web of trust + TOFU is basically social trust.
                - [[Ananth]] thinks that the key application of web3 is situations where there is no trusted central party. Blockchains talked about this first, but it’s a more general problem. Also, the key value these days isn’t generally in the content itself, but it the social graph.
                - [[Anuraj R]] thinks that a better definition of “web3” is blockchain + social graphs.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that Bluesky is already having moderation problems. Moderation is going to be __very__ important in decentralized networks.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] notes that they’ve also experienced more “meanness” on Bluesky. Farcaster seems like a nicer, more individualist place, while Bluesky seems to already have a lot of subcultural baggage. But maybe there’s an element of “an armed society is a polite society”? But Farcaster just seems to be composed of a lot of conflict-averse people. This suggests that the AT Protocol may be a more natural fit for groups.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] doesn’t quite buy the relationship between protocol and politeness.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that ownership is an important aspect to politeness. There are people who think ownership is fundamental (Farcaster), while others think ownership is instrumental (Bluesky). Mutualist tendencies are also important.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that the shape of the protocol and the people who initially populate it are important.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that the interaction here is that culture leads to changes in the protocol, which then further cements given cultural trends.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] wonders if “the medium is the message” applies to protocols as a whole, or just individual apps. The experience of Mastodon seems to suggest that protocols __are__ a medium.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] agrees, in the sense that protocols will evolve to make different moderation styles easier or harder.

            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Ben Mahala]] notes that the writers of this paper are fairly big names in the ZK proof space.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] is all for people trying to figure out soundness. Having “confidence intervals” around AI answers would be really valuable.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that this is interesting from a theoretical perspective, but doesn’t present any practical applications. It’s not really clear if what’s being tested here is “knowledge” in any useful sense.
                - [[Na]] notes that this is about __generalizing__ knowledge: Can I transpose knowledge into a different domain?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] observes that the question in this paper is not really “counting”, but “can I generalize my understanding of a fruit”?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] wonders what kind of knowledge current LLMs/LIMs have? At the moment, they “know” characteristics, but not necessarily semantics. But another kind of knowledge is about “solving equations”, which even people do (heuristically) even if they don’t “know” how to do it symbolically. LLMs seem to have this “birds know how to fly” sense, but don’t have a more general conceptual map. Is it possible to “know” about something like regular expressions in a “birds know how to fly” way?
                - [[Ananth]] generally found this interesting.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wonders what “knowledge” means in an LLM sense?
                - [[Drew Schorno]] notes that it’s about the ability to do a thing with new knowledge.
                - [[Ben Mahala]] tries to operationalize this by suggesting that you should be able to answer a question in a consistent way within some set of error bounds.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that knowledge can be measures in terms of “predictable mistakes” (and if those mistakes are within tolerances). Memory seems to be important here.
                - [[Na]] thinks that decoupling the notions of “intelligence” and “knowledge” may be useful here.
                - [[Ben Mahala]] thinks that the question of “knowledge” is one of being able to predict something consistently.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that we’re all circling around the idea of “knowledge” as “do you have an accurate map of the world”? And __how complex__ are these maps?
                - [[Ben Mahala]] worries that there will always be adversarial starting conditions that make an LLM look like it doesn’t “know” something.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] points out that an adversarial starting condition for human’s innate understanding of mechanics is our instinct to flinch when a pendulum that was released in front of us swings back around.

            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Maier Fenster]] notes that this leak paints a remarkably __not__ evil picture of Google. It doesn’t read like something a would-be monopolist would write. Google’s offerings are still inferior to OpenAI’s; that said, the open source people __do__ seem to be pushing a lot of what the Yak Collective is interested in. Perhaps open source and distributed systems can be a model for confronting monopolies?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] has a few observations...
                    - A throw-away observation: A side-note here is that “intellectual property” seems to be creating a lot of drag in this space. It seems that “open source” here means something more akin to William Gibson’s “the street finds its own use for things” than “open source” as the software institution.
                    - The distinction here between smaller, highly tuned models and larger generalist models is interesting. I’m __really__ curious as to what drives this, as well as the power of small, iterative improvements, though it may be that no one knows.
                    - The existence of a smarts vs. breadth trade-off isn’t surprising. You see this all the time in humans. Maybe being “smart” at everything is just a lot harder than we imagine?
                    - Relatedly, the power of __quality__ over __quantity__ in training data is highly suggestive. Also very __human__...
                    - There’s an interesting future sketched out here in local and “artisanal” LLMs. Apple should jump on this.
                    - Not an AI-specific observation, but it feels like a through line of this entire argument is a general problem I think Google suffers from: A focus on centralized cloud-based computing. It’s a focus that ignores both the relative power of edge devices, and the fact that networking still __sucks__ outside of small geographic areas. That a cloud/server-based solution isn’t working well here isn’t surprising, but I also don’t expect Google (or most of the tech sector) to do anything with this. Giving power to edge devices is anathema.
                    - You know who also is going to hate a world of edge-device AI? The AI safety/ethics people...
                - [[Ananth]] is skeptical that LLMs are going to be the “final frontier” model that everyone seems to think they are right now. It’s telling that Google’s lost so many AI people of late...
                - [[Anuraj R]] thinks that the idea that Google has “no moat” is a bit overblown. The code debugging models of GPT-4 is __way__ higher quality than these local models. This means that there will probably always be a market for larger model. Can “edge AI” really compete? Perhaps the future is edge models for simple tasks, with these models making calls out to a larger central model for harder tasks.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] riffs off of this, and imagines a world where more generalist LLMs running on the edge make calls to more specialist LLMs.
                - [[Anuraj R]] finds the work in this direction right now very interesting, and notes that [some systems are experimenting with BitTorrent](https://petals.ml/) for transferring data and connecting different parts of an LLM.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] notes that a “moat” isn’t just technology: It’s also branding. Is anyone actually interested in solving the problem of a __distributed__ LLM. Where’s the LLM that runs on both phones and computers and refrigerators.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that this is similar to Beowulf clusters. Perhaps there’s a future where there’s an “LLM module” that can be dropped into home automation systems. This turns “home automation” into something more like a “home cloud”.
                - [[Ananth]] observes that such “home LLM modules” could go a long way to making tools like Siri more useful, as well as solving the “shitty internet” problem.

                - > General reactions and speculate on what the world will be like if this argument is correct. — [Venkatesh Rao](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1122686297430052924/1122903247225638995)
            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Grigori Milov]] thinks that this argument fundamentally misunderstands software. However, if the argument __is__ right it will probably lead to ultra-customizable software. But this is likely to destroy the value of software, by making it too complex. Upgrade cycles may also increase, maybe even up to a daily cycle. But this is going to make it even harder to track new features and keep up with updates. New features are generally a thing that are explored by a minority of people, and most people don’t change their work patterns, so all this new software development will probably be for naught. The limit is how fast people can change their minds.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] has security-related thoughts...
                - [[Steven Chung]] is a bit skeptical of this argument, as they’ve been using ChatGPT-4 for coding and have found it lacking. It might be better to think of these tools less as “solve this problem for me” and more “give me a starting point”. Thinking of the __structure__ of your program is __really__ important, and manually typing code is probably not the bottleneck — code and ecosystem __complexity__ is the bottleneck. That said, if this thesis __is__ correct, this probably just accelerates existing trends. We may have more tools, but we’re bounded on demand... Not just how much people can __consume__, but importantly how much they can __imagine__.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] agrees that these tools are likely to be less (or even less-than) useful for serious/professional programmers. But the sweet spot of this technology might be the amateur/prosumer experience — small projects that take tens of lines of code, rather than hundreds or thousands. So, perhaps you don’t see Microsoft Word coming out of this, but maybe lots of Microsoft Word __plugins__. This is much more the realm of “bespoke variants of known problems”, which is probably easier both to debug and have AI write. Venkat actually thinks that upgrade cycles may get pushed __out__ by AI customizability — people are likely to demand __more__ stability in their (software) environment, rather than less. Think of AI coding as “duct-tape software engineering”. Like me, Venkat sees a world with __a lot__ more bespoke tools. More importantly, we’re used to software being both very __precise__ and very __fragile__; but perhaps this is a move to something more realistic, where software becomes more satisficing (“70% is good enough”). Perhaps this leads to a more __mediocre__ world.
                - [[Ananth]] liked this argument, but kept getting hung up on standards. There’s a real lack of standards in the space (or, when there are standards, there are __too many__ of them). A lot of what a software engineer does is choose what standards/libraries/etc. to loose. One advantage of the Ethereum virtual machine is that it’s an extremely constrained, specified environment... But this makes it a space that’s actually __easier__ to experiment in.
                - [[Anuraj R]] expands on Ananth’s argument: Standards make things __expensive__ in software. Things need to be certified, and then can’t be changed... Even if better solutions come along. The article’s arguments work for __simple__ software, but not anything of meaningful complexity.
                - [[Ben Mahala]] notes that many of the systems that this article classifies as “rules-based” are actually nothing of the sort — they’re an amalgam of rules and heuristics and social expectations and the current cultural moment. So, ChatGPT can’t replace these, but it’s also a misunderstanding to think that it __does__, or __can__... It’s basically Stack Overflow, a way of answering the question “am I on the right path?” But even if LLMs __do__ make coding much easier, there’s still the question of the __social__ interface for code. The transition from writing in assembly and writing in “code” was big, but it wasn’t __exponential__.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that this article may be right for the wrong reasons.

            - **Prompt**
                - > For tomorrow I thought we could do a review+planning session. A mix of review of readings since the last review plus craft a syllabus/map of summer season readings. The theme I have in mind is practical engineering of distributed systems since we’ve been dealing with abstract CS  stuff and kinda philosophical exploration of memory for a while. Hence the Increment archives as a core resource. But can add around that. Prompt: Pick 1-2 memorable article from the last 12 weeks (use thread index to review) to comment on. 15 min review time. We’ll use last 20 minutes to talk about summer season plan, themes of interest etc. — [Venkatesh Rao](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/904793053598998618/1125297023378272276)
            - **Meeting Notes**
                - [[Grigori Milov]] found the most memorable articles the lighter ones. The Farcaster protocol readings were the most interesting. How to build new social media networks around new communication primitives is fascinating. The “Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence” Microsoft paper was also interesting.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] found the general discussion around automation and its social interfaces the most inspiring and terrifying. How do we co-evolve with protocolization and automation? Jenna’s particularly interested in technological __undergrowth__: How do these things actually work? But we could talk more about how people actually __live__ with these systems.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] found the readings around Noosphere/Subsconscious the most interesting. Also, like Jenna, the discussions of how humans and computers work together __mutualistically__.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that we’re moving away from __distributed__ computing towards something more like __liquid__ computing, where the distinction between nodes are beginning to disintegrate. Venkat really liked the Datadog outage post-mortem. How do humans and distributed systems fail __together__? Complex interactions that span multiple levels of computing are particularly interesting. “Logic in memory” seems like an important concept... Increasingly important for AI hardware acceleration.
                - [[Ananth]] found the articles about ZK systems/proofs interesting. The article about hobo “sign language” fascinating; the core ideas from that seem to come up again and again in different contexts.
                - [[Anuraj R]] points out that the scope of the readings doesn’t __look__ much like a reading group about distributed systems.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that maybe we should expand the name? But we don’t want too much scope creep.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that “liquid computing” is an interesting idea. Our readings seem to orbit around “computation and network” and its interactions with “human society” writ large.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] points out that the social focus may be an artifact of the fact that this group originally grew out of the Governance Studies chat.
                - [[Grigori Milov]] likes the current name.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] wants to stay more technical for the next cycle. It may be interesting to do readings from a single source: [Increment Magazine](https://increment.com/issues/), from Stripe.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks that maybe we should use an entire issue, as many articles are very short.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] suggests that we pick a single core article, but then let people explore articles beyond this.

        - **Dec 11: 2022-23 Retrospective, Part 1 **| Discord thread | Youtube
            - For the next 2 weeks DSS sessions, we will survey the readings from the last 18 months (starting summer 2022) and do a round of sensemaking, mapping, and perhaps rescoping/redefinition. For tomorrow (Dec 11), the goal is to simply spend an hour re-familiarizing ourselves with everything we've read since the start of this group, identifying themes, key concepts, concept-clusters, lighthouse readings etc. As a sort of focusing challenge, the goal will be to come up with the most conceptually coherent 2-sentence scope and definition of "distributed systems" together. We'll each try to make up one definition each, then talk about how to elegantly synthesize it. I'm reasonably happy with the name here, but changing the name of the group is on the table if people feel that either the scope  and contents are incoherent, or that the name doesn't accurately reflect it. I'll post more precise prompt in the session thread. Here's the cleaned up Roam page with all the readings, links to threads etc.

        - Feb 12: [Cloudflare Thanksgiving Security Incident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident/) | [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1206617504861126656) 
            - 
                - [[Ananth]]
                    - Cloudflare is an important infrastrucure and cybersecurity company and so its spooky to even see them be a victim of attacks like this 
                    - Result of failure to rotate 1 service token and 3 service tokens of credentials involving a moveworks service token that granted access to their Atlassian system, a second one for Smartsheet, a third of Bitbucket service account that is used for source code management, and a fourth one for a AWS environment
                    - the supply chain of credentials transfer for access seems like an important vector in terms of vulnerabilities that needs to be closely monitored and guarded 
                    - appreciate the Cloudflare's leadership team trying to be transparent, publishing this and taking direct responsibilities albeit with a outbound link to Okta's issues which seems to have originated the attacks
                    - wonder if 9 days to threat detection is too long? 
                - [[Ben Mahala]]
                    - What happened to Cloudflare is a best-case scenario given that they have the expertise and commitment to fight the threats constantly and can squash them with further subsequent diligent postmortem and analysis.
                    - Cloudflare is one of the most important internet infrastructure companies in the industry, especially helping with DDoS attacks along with other critical functions in caching
                    - How many of the other companies can boast similar capacity in talent and desire to - deal with such a threat?
                    - Most companies are default software companies now and with that comes the responsibility of guarding against such attacks
                    - This could have been a major attack if it was another company
                    - The big question is how can relatively smaller companies subscribe to better operation security postures ?
                - [[Grigori]]
                    - Timeline of the events is most interesting. The attacker stayed on the network undetected for about 9 days rent-free. Of course, once detected the threat was handled swiftly
                    - Risk is what you don’t see. The question to ask is what risks are folks unaware of right now?
                    - We need a more robust presentation of the incident than what is currently presented
                    - Cloudflare being the 2nd largest infrastructure company makes this news worse given one can expect better standards from the blue-chip companies
                    - The article seems like an exercise in PR as supposed to making commitments to not let repeat actors be able to attack again
                    - Cloudflare is perhaps not being hard on itself as it should be given all the information is not easily accessible to the public. The public scrutiny could make the efforts more robust against such future attacks

                - [[Nathan Acks]]
                    - Being in charge of defensive systems is a challenge and this article does a good job of explaining the post-mortem steps
                    - Okta’s report seems much more perform-atory and much less informative.
                    - Cloudflare’s report was straightforward, we missed these tokens, these connections and perhaps threw Okta under the bus in order to deflect some responsibilities
                    - The mean time for threat detection used to be 3 months till some time ago. A decade ago it used to be 18 months. So 9 days seems like a huge improvement
                    - The threat was contained within 24 hours once detected is also excellent
                    - Least privilege is the best way of organizing IT with cloud services for Small businesses
                    - Zero Trust is about continuous monitoring
                    - Hardware security keys are a fight against organizational inertia to get deployed though once deployed is appreciated by everyone. You need more multi-factor authorizations to be secure
                    - These sorts of attacks are quite cheap and are not that sophisticated. There’re guides online on how to do this.
                    - which raises the question, how do you deal with this as a small org? Even as Yak Collective?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - Reading the report felt like reading a Sci-Fi account
                    - The job of OpSec folks seems very high stress
                    -  The system is setup to have asymmetric costs and hence justifies the attack. Similar to the case with Isreal and Palestine with cheap rockets vs Iron Dome where the defense costs orders of magnitude more. Physical DDoS defenders spend a lot of money on this
                    - As a result of few tokens comprisoed, it required Cloudflare to rotate 1000s of tokens + became the engineering priority for a big chunk of the team at Cloudflare which leads to other unseen costs. Their effort to return even not compromised equipments in their Brazil Data Center while seems like an over-reaction, also adds to the costs of these attacks.
                    - The asymmetry also succeeds in creating a cloud of security doubt around 5-6 major organizations involved here
                    - Need for a macroeconomics study of security postures quantifying the cost of these attacks
                    - And, finally, how complex a system should be without sacrificing elegance? Could we getaway from perimeter security to endpoint security? Is that a complication or simplification?
                - Post first-round discussion
                    - [[Nathan Acks]]
                        - The lopsided ratio of economics can also be looked at from the lense of immune response to virus attacks 
                        - What viruses do in biological systems are not that complex but the cost to treat them is quite high on the body? 
                        - Millions of viruses try to harm biological systems all the time but we have developed a passive immune response to such attacks that most of them go unnoticed 
                        - Perhaps that's the way to think about OpSec hygiene? To develop passive responses 
                        - That can include things like hardware security keys, SSH for secure connections across networks, clear access/credentials segmentation, more passwords, and cryptographic keys 
                        - Recall working at an NGO that had no aspiration to expand but was still under constant attacks. Had to resort to blacklisting and nerfing of different kinds. 
                        - Internet is costly and there're more attacks than one might think 
                        - There's some rational behind the take that a lot of the modern tech is a mistake, the Internet was a bad move that's still popular among some circles 
                        - We moved very quickly and didn't quite spend time thinkning about the security 
                        - resorted to just integrating with cryptography at the TCP/IP level
                        - We opted to have the capability but not securely conflating internet of executable and internet of data 
                        - It is trivially easy to own a box just with terminal emulators in a text box with control characters
                        - Having special purpose devices. known communication channels., known protocols could be a way forward, special purpose devices for high-security applications
                        -  UNIX philosophy, targeted apps loosely coupled is better than huge monolithic projects that are typically hard to defend 
                    - [[Ben Mahala]]
                        - designing systems with good OpSec hygiene are almost like biological systems with the body envelopes getting punctured often by the hostile environment leading to non-linear increase in costs and with it an ability to develop immune response
