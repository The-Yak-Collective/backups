- Created as a broadening of the [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]. The Distributed Systems Study Group has a broader scope, and covers:
    - Distributed computing (technical)
        - Including Blockchain technologies
    - Distributed computing (social)
    - Distributed systems generally (including swarms in nature etc)
- The goal is to have a track complementary to the [[Governance Studies]] track, with a more technological focus.
- We aim to create a [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] as our work product over the summer
- There is interest in creating a prompt-school type track around this, and we will be trialing this over the summer.

                                    - think human-based systems have a more viable option of reach-through from one hierarchy level to another. the ones we care about are dynamic to , like a flock of birds, so the leader (of which there can be many at once) take turns at different effective places in hierarchy. in his words - i think the systems we care about are not near decomposable as he suggests most social systems are.
                                    - __one cannot, for example, enact the role of "friend" with large numbers of other people.__
                                    - it seems like the focus on hierarchy detracts from analyzing the  links between components.

                        - The user experience on Discord is cluttered
                        - Good to have visibility of reading lists
                        - Difficult to track messages. If you are not embedded in the community then it difficult to jump into something
                    - [[Grigori Milov]]

                    - [[Maier Fenster]]
                        - we have more hopes than people to do the stuff
                        - we need people not only who build it but also people who use it in addition to people who would improve it
                        - the infra part needs traction either from user side or builder side
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                        - Reason for mismatch between hopes and execution could be because there it is distributed volunteer based product
                        - New user onboarding is lacking at the moment. Difficult for them get in the community. How to onboard outsiders? 
                        - YC is between public space and private space

            - Prompt - What did find interesting in the paper? 
            - Discussion
                - [[Anuraj R]] - timestamps for sync? trivial method?
                - [[Ben Mahala]] - seeds of byzantine fault tolerance
                    - all nodes communicate first, and if they contacted every node 
                    - all the things that start from here and flow into the current systems
                    - if there is a crash in one node it takes down all systems, but this has been solved in today's systems
                - [[Grigori Milov]]
                    - in the middle of article the usefullness of order of events is questioned
                    - play it local, maybe a more recent article on syncing in distributed system would give a better view
                    - what ever happends on global system does not matter until locally processed, local times scale more important? 
                - [[Nathan Acks]]
                    - pick pockets, how they fake sensation of things on the body
                    - [[Commits Vortex]]
                        - hand illusion, rubber hand after partition in a table, people feel illusion on the rubber hand even though it is not their real hand
                    - a lot of what the brain is doing is anticipating the events,  
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - new advances in databases 10 years ago - spanner system, that line of research began in this paper
                    - Paxos - first reading of the summer
                    - this is works under 
                    - the non trivialiality can be appreciated one the lack of data is known, that is a central time keeping
                    - distributed system is unnatural, eg is blind and there is baton/ball to pass on another person, how to pass the ball so that everyone gets to play with the ball
                    - trade off central time keeping and message verbosity(everyone talks to everyone)
                    - byzantine fault tolerance increase the complexity of this problem
                    - relation to physics and space-time is fascinating

                    - member rights, user rights
                    - social software: need to understand social context (take advantage of it and be ready for the emergent challenges) and design for the social patterns as much as technological affordances

            - Prompt -  Think of an example you’ve encountered of this principle and comment on whether there are important conditions where the tradeoff can be broken. 
            - Discussion
                - [[Nathan Acks]] - trade off between optimal and robust solution in applied maths
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] - dealt with issue in almost everything touched
                    - who gets to decide is the real question, pick two - fast, efficient, cheap
                - [[Grigori Milov]] - easy to find examples
                    - good distinction between individual and collective decisions
                    - in some orgs decisions are made collectively, while in others decisions individually while execution collectively
                - [[Ben Mahala]] - frontier defined by this is technology dependent, a new tech can help in getting more efficiency
                    - lot of orgs tend to be dishonest about actual place on the trade-offs
                    - lot of entities in principle have to follow thouroughness but don't 
                    - chemical safety board youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/USCSB/videos
                    - if there is a possibility of catatrophe then it can be spread 
                    - thouroughness and efficiency both take effort 
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - Noah Sussman called it CAP theorem for humans
                    - ETTO at the org level ends being bureucracy vs private sector tradeoff
                    - can see the same things in accounting, policing, eg of where one leans to thouroughness it leans to bureucracy 
                    - DAO vs traditional startup companies
                    - decentraliced tech leans towards thourougness and centralized leans towards efficiency

                        - accountability(power differential -Ben's suggestion), thourouhness, efficiency
                - Open Floor
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] - our perceptions of ourselves tend to be not correct to reality
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] - we all end up on the spectrum somewhere, some funkies who tend to live up to the standard set up by the person in power
                    - [[Ben Mahala]] - in decentralized systems these sort of dishonesty is difficult to do. in a group when everyone is a peer it is difficult to do. can't loosen rules locally without loosening it globally
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - eg multi-sig gnosis safe
                        - meta lesson with YakCollective - of all the experiments thoroughness experiments succeed more often then efficiency experiments

                    - difficult to run such structures without some people doing the centralizing work
                    - when times are bad there is strong incentive is make it centralized

            - notes::
                - [[Ananth]] notes that civility is important for the smooth functioning of much of society. US road signs seem to embody certain aspects of the US culture, and the __constraint__ dimension of this culture are actually quite important.
                - [[Anuraj R]] (in chat) counters that the US/India comparison may be apples/oranges.
                - [[Ben Mahala]] notes that traffic __is__ a microcosm of society. But one important thing to keep in mind is that US roads are much more heavily policed than in many other countries. This enables traffic to flow more smoothly, but there __is__ an advantage to slower, more chaotic traffic: It __may__ enforce more situational awareness and lower speeds, which may in turn lead to a __safer__ traffic situation. Simple, embodied, rules seem good. It's not clear how much the driving example generalizes to politics, however. Driving is a more cooperative(ish) game than politics.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] (in chat) notes that Indian traffic fatality rates are actually higher than in the US ([1](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1084613012272451604/1084859658176573581), [2](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/1084613012272451604/1084859733778899055)).
                - [[Grigori Milov]] found the article biased and rhetorically weak. This even comes out in the pictures: The US example photo shows __many__ fewer cares than the Indian picture. A US street with as many cars as the example Indian street would probably need some sort of manual intervention (police) to function. The article was also very data-light. Also, are stop signs really necessary? Maybe all that's necessary is a rule about how to function at an intersection.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] thought that the article's three-point summary was actually quite good. In Maine, there's a lot of snowmobile accidents, partly because the rules of the road (hand signals, in the case of snowmobiles) aren't as well established.
                - [[Shreeda Segan]] found the article's __structure__ annoying (it's very TED Talk-ish), but thinks that __is__ on to something: It's remarkable how many __different__ kinds of neurotypes can cooperate in driving (because of the simple rules?). It would be interesting to see how __sticky__ traffic norms are culturally. What is the history here? What does social enforcement look like? How do norms and rules interact to enforce/weaken each other? (For example, someone not turning on green is likely to get honked at. But someone just moving too slowly in the left lane will just get passed on the right.)
                - [[Steven Chung]] remembers an article they ran into about roundabouts being more efficient than stop signs. Do stop signs allow for greater traffic density? Are they more efficient?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] (in chat) notes that roundabouts are indeed more efficient than four-way stops.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] notes that there were two big changes they encountered when re-learning how to drive after moving from India to the US: Driving on the other side of the road, and the sheer __speed__ at which traffic moves in the US. Like, US traffic can move at a truly terrifying rate compared to elsewhere in the world. One important thing to remember is that when traffic gets chaotic, people avoid it. This leads to a bit of a tragedy of the commons in India w.r.t. traffic: Only the bravest people travel in the densest, most chaotic areas, and those people tend to choose more maneuverable modes of transit that can actually make congestion __worse__ (even if the individual drivers can navigate more effectively). Chaotic traffic situations, even slow ones, __are__ truly dangerous. Clear, enforced rules allow more people to participate in those systems; this is not just about how well the system works, but also the sheer psychological stress that chaotic situations can induce in their participants. That said, it's likely that near optimal outcomes will appear quite chaotic, especially in higher dimensional spaces.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that one reason traffic rules may work is because people in the US are actually abnormally cooperative. Having simple, explicit rules may help with this: Even if simple rules aren't as efficient as a more complex ruleset, you can get greater social buy-in with them, because people are better able to understand __how__ they fit into the system and __what__ is expected from them (and what they can in turn expect).
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] agrees that Americans really do appear to be abnormally cooperative. They like to work together. Even de Tocqueville observed this. India can sometimes be the reverse though: On the surface very cooperative, but very "out for number one" when push comes to shove. Interestingly, even foreigners will switch out these cooperative norms on a moment's notice. There might be a 2x2 here: Order vs. chaos on one axis and deep vs. superficial cooperation on the other.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] observes that some homeless folks in South Africa were providing __ad hoc__ traffic signaling services during some recent large-scale power outages. There's a good question here about how __strongly__ rules/norms should be enforced. When is it okay for a norm to be (soft) broken? BBC From Our Own Correspondent:

                - [[Vinay Débrou]]
            - notes::
                - [[Steven Chung]] thought that the blog post was perhaps overly-optimistic, and that the loop would require more iterations and fine-tuning than Webb's examples. That said, the code so far __does__ look really simple. The applications to writing code are interesting.
                - [[Ananth]] finds LangChain really interesting, and thinks that article does a good job of both describing the uses of this framework and the more general ReAct approach. Robin Sloan's observation that LLMs may become "universal couplers", just generic text over TCP, seems right. One thing that this approach might help with is the conversion of the physical domain into the simulation domain; doing this is kind of a dark art right now, and an AI-in-the-loop approach might make this a lot faster/easier. That said, Ananth felt that the examples were somewhat trivial, and the leap to "the Singularity is nigh!" was not really supported. But the applications are really interesting.
                - [[Anuraj R]] also found the end of the article ("the Singularity is nigh!") was annoying. The ReAct loop has some similarities to current programming paradigms. Anuraj has been using ChatGPT as a kind of "interactive Stack Overflow".
                    - [[Steven Chung]] has also been using ChatGPT similarly.
                - [[Commits Vortex]] is in listen-only mode...
                - [[Grigori Milov]] thinks that the ReAct framework is already something that disciplined human thinking uses. So LLMs helping us do this faster seems like a no-brainer. AI systems still seem to be weak at __real__ observation right now; people don't base their thinking on a single observation, but rather experiments and life experience that contain __many__ data points we draw inferences from. Figuring out when a data point is "bullshit" is hard, and right now AI doesn't seem to have a good way of building out a "bullshit detector" for the data it ingests. How to teach a machine intuition? Also, "the Singularity is nigh" was annoying to Grigori as well. As a counter-example, consider chess: The best machines can beat the best humans, but not by much of a margin. Even this domain-specific brute-forcing approach only gives a computer a __little__ bit of an edge. And chess is very simple compared to the real world. Machines might be better than us, but not that much better. So a little bit of hope there.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that there's a never-ending difficulty "managing underlings". Virtual assistants have some of the same scoping problems. The best use of delegation is simple, "dumb" tasks that are maybe hard to code explicitly, but so simple we don't want to do them ourselves. Jenna wonders when the process described in the article will become simple enough to be broadly accessible. Jenna is reminded of a book that had a smart agent like this, that would go off and study interesting questions and then discuss the results, which would be an interesting interface paradigm.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] is in listen-only mode...
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that, based on this article and their own experiences, this sort of loop is a good idea. Shorter, focused prompts with a subsequent human response seems to work well. Like Jenna, Venkat isn't looking forward to a future where we have to manage smart, enthusiastic, and mistake-prone virtual assistants. The best managerial roles are more partnerships where you're in continuous, informal interaction with competent, experienced peers. AIs seems to be a long way from this, but an approach like this may be promising.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that, to make a __Star Trek__ analogy, everyone thinks we're building Data, and really what we're building here is the ship's computer (which none of the crew members would ever mistake as anything other than a tool). Also, there's some real non-code limits to how fast an AI can iterate itself. LLMs are not just code, but also weighted models based on huge data sets. This data has to come from somewhere, and will take time to process (even if the code to do that processing, or then run inferences on that data set, can be improved on). Also, ChatGPT and its ilk are __very__ expensive from a hardware perspective, and improvements in GPUs, etc. are much harder to come by than improvements in code.
                - [[Anuraj R]] agrees that the hardware aspects of AI are hard to iterate on.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that there's a proposal on the server to share prompt recipes. This could be interesting/fun. Jenna wants a simple, obvious toggle for these systems that switches them between "things I know" and "things I don't know". Basically, what data source is the AI drawing from.

                - [[Bryan King]] observes that all of the LLMs seem to be "deep generalists", but often function in a very surface level, like a particular kinda of Twitter personality. So to Bryan, these models feel very close to human-level. But human-level intelligence may not be the bottle neck for making things happen. AI feels like a "so what?" moment; Bryan really struggles to find a use for the current crop of AI tools. It might be useful as a one-off thing, but is it really useful for big projects? Do AIs produce maintainable systems?
                - [[Grigori Milov]] agrees with the papers authors that "intelligence" is a slippery concept. It can kind of be anything; almost any one-dimensional definition breaks down, and multi-dimensional definitions become a kind of "I'll know it when I see it" problem. A lot of the discussion right now is thus retrospective: Rather than coming up with forward-looking tests and definitions, people are asking how well it can perform already-defined tasks. How much of GPT-4's performance is just memorization? Grigori thinks the key here is the concept of __mastery__, which suggests that the questions the authors are asking are the wrong ones. How could we learn from a future iteration of this AI? This may require us to learn how to be "interesting" to the LLM...
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] is in listen-only mode today.
                - [[Kyle Mathews]] has been playing around a lot with LLMs in the last year. It's pretty hit-or-miss right now; the reliability just isn't there, though it __is__ useful when asking questions that are normally swamped by spam in search. For programming, ChatGPT requires __a lot__ of review. GitHub's CoPilot seems more useful. OpenAI's plugin architecture looks like a real game-changer.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] has been working on a presentation about how generative AI will impact IP law. Maier sees it as kind of the opposite of the internet; AI is about zeitgeist, while the internet is about specifics. GPT-4 is __very__ good at generating and processing words; this seems like something patent attorneys might use to describe a new invention. ChatGPT as an "explanation engine" seems like it will be a big deal. It seems like __generating__ text is going to become easier, but __understanding__ text (in particular, sorting signal from noise __within__ a document) is going to be harder. ChatGPT is already good enough to write a bad patent.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] sees GPT-4 as a symbolic manipulator, and is interested in automation.
                - [[Steven Chung]] is in listen-only mode.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] thinks that this paper actually defines the concept of "general" more reasonably, as "human equivalence". There's a central question here of whether __humans__ are actually "general intelligences", or just __more__ general than other species on Earth. Certainly GPT-4 is __much__ more general than previous LLMs, but it still experiences __a lot__ of hallucinations and still goes on a lot of tangents. Processing the output of GPT-4 seems to be roughly as hard as processing interactions with "the real world". Calculators meaningfully reduce how "smart" people need to be: Now we don't need to know arithmetic (beyond the basic symbols and logic). But GPT-4 doesn't provide this sort of affordance; for example, if you ask for an essay, you still have to edit the whole thing. And editing is often harder than creating. So we're not really meaningfully __reducing__ the amount of intelligence required of humans, and in fact may be __increasing__ the requirements (debugging/editing/etc. is hard!). What happens when people begin using LLMs to substitute for things like StackOverflow? The only way to get around this loss may be to have the model train itself from its own users' __inputs__. But how do you get out of corner cases, where there are few, if any examples to train the AI but the task is meaningfully human-complex?
                - [[Ananth]] thinks the mathematical reasoning portion of the paper was particularly interesting. The fact that GPT-4 breaks so easily when doing mathematics is potentially telling. But it __is__ good at sketching out answers that require cross-disciplinary knowledge, and it also seems good at Fermi Estimation. Ananth is skeptical that GPT-4 is really "general" yet; non-linear thinking and working memory seem to be real problems. The models __are__ surprisingly creative, and seems to be reasonably good at working within constraints.
