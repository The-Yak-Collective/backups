- Created as a broadening of the [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]. The Distributed Systems Study Group has a broader scope, and covers:
    - Distributed computing (technical)
        - Including Blockchain technologies
    - Distributed computing (social)
    - Distributed systems generally (including swarms in nature etc)
- The goal is to have a track complementary to the [[Online Governance Studies]] track, with a more technological focus.
- We aim to create a [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] as our work product over the summer
- There is interest in creating a prompt-school type track around this, and we will be trialing this over the summer.
