- Created as a broadening of the [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]. The Distributed Systems Study Group has a broader scope, and covers:
    - Distributed computing (technical)
        - Including Blockchain technologies
    - Distributed computing (social)
    - Distributed systems generally (including swarms in nature etc)
- The goal is to have a track complementary to the [[Online Governance Studies]] track, with a more technological focus.
- We aim to create a [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] as our work product over the summer
- There is interest in creating a prompt-school type track around this, and we will be trialing this over the summer.

                - Nathan: Recovery from failure? Maximal system integrity, optimize for correctness?
        - Prompt: Come up with ONE question about distributed systems that you don’t know the answer to, either social or technical . Plus general comments about the reading.
        - Prompt: Based on what you know, add as many terms as you can in 15 minutes to the [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] lexicon section. Both technical and non-technical terms invited.
    3. July 4: No meeting, US July 4th

        - Article - Quadratic Voting

                - Mechanism too clever, fine in domains they exist in. Lack simplicity
                - One person - One vote has strong narrative. It feels fair
                - There is not easy case study to intuitively know it
                - Problems with Identity and Collusion
                - People need to know what exactly they want. Not sure how much this system would work in the case when people don't know what they want
                - People might not hook into this system
            - [[Bryan King]]
                - Rank Choice Voting
                - It reduces gamesmanship. In US elections, a third party cannot ascend, as voting for third party is risky? 
                - Interesting part is obscuring of preference
                - Spectrum of of how much you care, and there are many people who don't care
                - Advertising section is interesting
            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - Article misses the issue of power which also exist which is not evenly distributed in a system
                - In the presence of power, the fluidity of new system compared to old one (one person one vote), the danger of moving to unstable system
                    - easy to make a complex system, cubic system etc
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - The math is interesting. 
                - Ben's point of not having a meta-narrative
                    - [[Ben Mahala]]
                - Eg routing of TCP packets and algos for it
                    - CSMA by CD,
                    - Telephone game
                - People can't do it for troubleshooting but not as default
                - Grigori's point of slippery slope
                    - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - Diodes, triodes etc
                - The system depends on people knowing how much they care
                - Time in Yak Collective gives your certain voting tokens?

                - Vickrey auction, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction
                - Power holders in the system
                    - Buying power in quadratic system also depends on real world buying power
                    - Have to shield quadratic voting from real world inequalities
                - At some point one person - one vote was also established
            - Open Floor
                - [[Ben Mahala]]
                    - lot of work needs to be done to make this system viable
                    - does not mean we should give up on this, but good to know there are limits to this system
                    - EIP-1599 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md
                    - Delegation is also important thing to look at, Liquid Democracy
