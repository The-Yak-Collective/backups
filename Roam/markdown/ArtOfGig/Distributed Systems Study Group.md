- Created as a broadening of the [[Blockchain Ops Roadmap]]. The Distributed Systems Study Group has a broader scope, and covers:
    - Distributed computing (technical)
        - Including Blockchain technologies
    - Distributed computing (social)
    - Distributed systems generally (including swarms in nature etc)
- The goal is to have a track complementary to the [[Governance Studies]] track, with a more technological focus.
- We aim to create a [[Distributed Systems Map and Lexicon]] as our work product over the summer
- There is interest in creating a prompt-school type track around this, and we will be trialing this over the summer.

                                - think human-based systems have a more viable option of reach-through from one hierarchy level to another. the ones we care about are dynamic to , like a flock of birds, so the leader (of which there can be many at once) take turns at different effective places in hierarchy. in his words - i think the systems we care about are not near decomposable as he suggests most social systems are.
                                - __one cannot, for example, enact the role of "friend" with large numbers of other people.__
                                - it seems like the focus on hierarchy detracts from analyzing the  links between components.

                    - Grew up organically
                    - All Discord bots hosted on Vultr server and written in python. Mostly stateless
                    - Website was initially using GitHub pages but now uses Netlify. Netlify builds the jekyll website
                    - GitHub actions addition to infra would be great. Eg [Lunch-time tickets](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/lunchtime-tickets)
                - [[Commits Vortex]]
                    - The user experience on Discord is cluttered
                    - Good to have visibility of reading lists
                    - Difficult to track messages. If you are not embedded in the community then it difficult to jump into something
                - [[Grigori Milov]]

                            - Take exhaust on Discord and show on Profile on Webpage
                        - Infrastructure simplification
                            - Design principles on how bots should behave
                - [[Maier Fenster]]
                    - we have more hopes than people to do the stuff
                    - we need people not only who build it but also people who use it in addition to people who would improve it
                    - the infra part needs traction either from user side or builder side
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - Reason for mismatch between hopes and execution could be because there it is distributed volunteer based product
                    - New user onboarding is lacking at the moment. Difficult for them get in the community. How to onboard outsiders?

            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - in the middle of article the usefullness of order of events is questioned
                - play it local, maybe a more recent article on syncing in distributed system would give a better view
                - what ever happends on global system does not matter until locally processed, local times scale more important?

                - the non trivialiality can be appreciated one the lack of data is known, that is a central time keeping
                - distributed system is unnatural, eg is blind and there is baton/ball to pass on another person, how to pass the ball so that everyone gets to play with the ball
                - trade off central time keeping and message verbosity(everyone talks to everyone)
                - byzantine fault tolerance increase the complexity of this problem
                - relation to physics and space-time is fascinating
                - twitter had ordering problems, now it seems ordered, they seemed to have solved it locally

                - public square is becoming less good than it was before
            - [[Ben Mahala]]
                - medieval town square was the one public space
                - limited public space in meatspace vs inifinite group space on the internet
                - groups need member-trimming and membership criteria
                - multiple moderators
            - [[Commits Vortex]]
                - scale is the key thing
                - social stickiness is interesting from voice/exit lens
                - dead discord servers
                - these patterns are persisting - see them in many communities that go dead (discord servers)
            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - doesnt take the prompt for granted
                - software doesnt fail, groups fail
                - groups need structure
                - default structure is hierarchy

                - not every software is made for many-to-many interactions
                - Dunbar limit for dense subgraph (tight-knit communities) : around 150 people
                - Density: scaling and density(of edges) of social graph doesn't go together
                - there is a always an emergent core group: visibly recognized for their effort/commitment as members vs users
                - Structure: need for a constitution/governance structure that rolls out the values charter: additional power to the more committed core group
                - member rights, user rights
                - social software: need to understand social context (take advantage of it and be ready for the emergent challenges) and design for the social patterns as much as technological affordances
                - identity : emergent reputations not designed ones
                - member level recognition

    15. Sept 26: [ETTO Principle](https://erikhollnagel.com/onewebmedia/ETTO.pdf)
        - Reading Article - https://erikhollnagel.com/onewebmedia/ETTO.pdf
        - Prompt -  Think of an example you’ve encountered of this principle and comment on whether there are important conditions where the tradeoff can be broken. 
        - Discussion
            - [[Nathan Acks]] - trade off between optimal and robust solution in applied maths
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] - dealt with issue in almost everything touched
                - who gets to decide is the real question, pick two - fast, efficient, cheap
            - [[Grigori Milov]] - easy to find examples
                - good distinction between individual and collective decisions
                - in some orgs decisions are made collectively, while in others decisions individually while execution collectively
            - [[Ben Mahala]] - frontier defined by this is technology dependent, a new tech can help in getting more efficiency
                - lot of orgs tend to be dishonest about actual place on the trade-offs
                - lot of entities in principle have to follow thouroughness but don't 
                - chemical safety board youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/USCSB/videos
                - if there is a possibility of catatrophe then it can be spread 
                - thouroughness and efficiency both take effort 
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - Noah Sussman called it CAP theorem for humans
                - ETTO at the org level ends being bureucracy vs private sector tradeoff
                - can see the same things in accounting, policing, eg of where one leans to thouroughness it leans to bureucracy 
                - DAO vs traditional startup companies
                - decentraliced tech leans towards thourougness and centralized leans towards efficiency
                - one way to complete CAP theorem in humans 
                    - accountability(power differential -Ben's suggestion), thourouhness, efficiency
            - Open Floor
                - [[Nathan Acks]] - our perceptions of ourselves tend to be not correct to reality
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] - we all end up on the spectrum somewhere, some funkies who tend to live up to the standard set up by the person in power
                - [[Ben Mahala]] - in decentralized systems these sort of dishonesty is difficult to do. in a group when everyone is a peer it is difficult to do. can't loosen rules locally without loosening it globally
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - eg multi-sig gnosis safe
                    - meta lesson with YakCollective - of all the experiments thoroughness experiments succeed more often then efficiency experiments

            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - decentralized structures are not getting destroyed by external powers
                - difficult to run such structures without some people doing the centralizing work
                - when times are bad there is strong incentive is make it centralized
                - slow decision making in decentralized systems
            - [[Meredith Noelle]]

            - [[Ben Mahala]]
                - middle ages was mostly a time of centralized states were weak

                - what sort of protocols would people create? 
                - time is interesting aspect of protocol
                    - stateless protocols without aspect of time is not a protocol?

                - Major flaw is registering identity on chain
                - Mastodon - low barrier entry
                - pet name system https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petname
            - [[Bryan King]]
                - UX of twitter
                - some problems of mastodon
                - irc - pgp kind of tool
                - meta discourse on Twitter about Twitter
                - social design first and technical later
                - this feels like exit over voice
            - [[Commits Vortex]]
                - Mastodon might open up horizons of fediverse
                - different affordances compared to twitter
                - the ability to extend actions at the protocol level seems interesting and unique from api approach 
                - in terms of protocol, two things
                    - 1. "Fids can be transferred between addresses, though the FIR ensures that an address owns only one fid at a time."  -- I can't work out what this means
                    - 2. "If the custody address does not cancel the transfer within three days, the recovery address can complete the transfer."
- What is the notification system for this?
- Wouldn't it be better to say "if the recovery address does no complete the transfer within three days, then the transfer fails."?

                - governance issue - how the protocol can be changed - anyone can propose and then team decides
                - evolution of twitter - importance to notice the evolutionary path of twitter. Farcaster seems at the starting point of twitter
                - evolutionary forces centralization
                - monetization mechanism
                - smaller clients for twitter failed
                - ad based system forces centralization
            - [[Jenna Dixon]]
                - section 7 - security consideration - swarm actor, bot attacks
                - stability without stagnation
                - Dan Romero's podcast - https://share.transistor.fm/s/ca91681a
                - way to use twitter - use list, join conversation later
            - [[Maier Fenster]]
                - Governance Issue 
                - Twitter chaos - what are the needs of the people and communications platform of a billion people
                - FC protocol seems to be for sending messages between computers
                - shaming attacks how to prevent? is it possible with the protocol
                - proposol - can you decentralize the followers? https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HkcscxJ8i
            - [[Nathan Acks]]
                - it is so close to being a generic messaging protocol
                - how to handle large amount of data going around
                - bad applications - what if someone uses FC for nefarious activities
                - timestamp messages - hard problem
                - having onchain identity might be important
            - [[Shreeda Segan]]
                - own client design, antithetical to scaling
                - network growth
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - is it crypto+mastodon? maybe not. here the intent hubs to be similar to email providers
                - email is dominated by few and others sent to spam
                - email is basically a global headspace
                - email/twitter is salt water medium. local stuff is freshwater
                - mastodon had freshwater medium feel. 
                - hubs here have responsibility towards global casts, each hub can make decision of history storage
                - social layer attacks are by client  handle these
                - governance level - not satisfactory
                - vc funded firm - both of client and protocol
                - non trivial decentralized governance in ETH
                - next move is web, there will be no crypto needed, crypto global namespace is transparent
                - this could potentially grow in decentralized governance
            - Open Floor
                -  [[Nathan Acks]] - data portability, hub structure allows porting data
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - 
                    - if you control the handle and data, then one create a rebel network, 
                    - usenet fragmented into two layers
