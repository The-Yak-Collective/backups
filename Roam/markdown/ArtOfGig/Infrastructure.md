    - Infrastructure Chat 50 [[May 5th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Nathan Acks]], [[Oliver King]]
    - Infrastructure Chat 49 [[April 28th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Nathan Acks]], [[Jenna Dixon]], [[Phil Wolff]]
        - **Notes**
            - [[Nathan Acks]] got on a few minutes late, and so missed some notes...
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] is looking to improve some of the existing bots. The goal is to automate Yak Talk a bit more.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that there's a bot now for pulling links (`$links`). It looks like this is part of onboarding_robot. Ideally this might just be the upcoming events + a list of links.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] notes that the next step would be to generate a list of robots + commands to generate/read this.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] thinks that newsletters should start on the website, and then move into the newsletter. Potential bots: Last week content, upcoming, etc. There should be *one* place people go to get raw data.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] would ideally like a script that daily pulls what happened on Discord, events, shared links, maybe agenda items.
        - **Follow-Up**
            - In the Yak Talk [[Newsletter Bot Doc]], identify which bot does what from [[Phil Wolff]]'s list in `#voice-meta`:
                - Upcoming events via the eventbot. 
                - The last week context in links.
                - About YakC boilerplate text (perhaps grabbed from a specific Roam page, so easy to update)
                - monthly leaderboard list of top/trending few channels. 
                - of channels showing signs of life (low-levels up from quiet)
                - excerpts from links in Yak Writings
                - excerpts from Soapbox, but needs a bit of human markup and queuing.

        - participants:: [[Bryan King]] [[Jenna Dixon]] [[Oliver King]] [[Phil Wolff]] [[Maier Fenster]]
        - **Notes**
            - [[Oliver King]] wants to make the channels more legible. Can we differentiate projects from channels, active from non-active, etc.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] brings up their past experiences with the emoji prefixes as what __not__ to do.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] suggests a quarterly cadence of changes to the Discord server.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] and [[Oliver King]] like the quarterly cadence idea.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] proposes having a weekly change poll in the **Announcements** channel.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] asks why we're talking about polling.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that the problem with the emoji change was that it was bigger than folks expected.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] suggests the reverse: Make the change, but leave a changelog so that people can respond and things can be reverted.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] is worried that some people only check in infrequently. Perhaps a monthly cadence?
            - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that a monthly cadence is too slow. Maybe a changelog + discussion of some sort.
            - [[Phil Wolff]] likes a more anarchic approach.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] is worried that there's a tension between illegibility and engagement.
            - [[Oliver King]] likes anarchy in principle, but doesn't think that waiting a week to catch objections is too much to ask. But, how do we do this without everyone becoming an admin? Also, what does a `yakherder` do?
            - [[Nathan Acks]] I'm honestly not sure what a `yakherder` does?
            - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that right now the main issue is that we have people with vision, but they're all worried about offending other folks.
            - [[Oliver King]] wants to pin this, but thinks that we should perhaps spin this out as a weekly questions.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] asks if this is the right time to switch to using Knack for sign-ups?
            - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that the key tension here is between minimizing information gathering and normalizing the use of Knack.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks that this also hooks into the question of whether we should have an internal newsletter.
            - [[Bryan King]] only has about an hour this week.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that we should switch out the sign-up form this week, but can't commit. So it's really up to Bryan.
            - [[Bryan King]] points out that most of the time they spent over the weekend was trying to coordinate requirements, not actual implementation.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] seconds this.
            - [[Oliver King]] points out that this comes back a bit to how hard publishing is. Perhaps we should hold-off on any more infrastructure-related activities until there's a clearer roadmap.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] doesn't have a solution to the larger problem, but suggests that a meta-ticket in GitHub outlining how to move into Knack might be helpful.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] doesn't think this would be helpful now. We need to lock down governance more first.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that they'd [written up their own channel reorganization proposal]([[Nathan Acks' March 2021 Discord Channel Organization Change Proposal]]), centered around permissioning. we're heading in a different direction now, but perhaps something from that document will be useful for Oliver, __et al.__?
    - Infrastructure Chat 44 [[March 24th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Bryan King]] [[Jenna Dixon]] [[Oliver King]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Phil Wolff]]
        - **Agenda**
            - Me stepping back (what is there to discuss?)
            - ~~Discord channel organization discussion.~~
                - ~~Maybe (Probably!) this should be supplemented with better channel descriptions~~
        - **Notes**
            - Bryan is more of a frontend/designer type person.
            - Bryan can handle webpage roll-out, design work,Â __some__Â ongoing maintenance. Not so much backend/architecture/integration stuff.
            - Oliver suggests that maybe we move to Notion for publishing. Something lower code. There are connect-and-publish solutions for Notion.
            - Nathan wonders how we can do some of our automation in Notion?
            - Maier thinks we should just let people load things into GitHub.
            - Nathan wonders if we should use WordPress as a backend?
            - Bryan uses Ghost for everything. They have an API that can be used to build websites. It's built by some of the old WordPress core people. Would require our own server. Seems to be NodeJS + SQLite. Maybe ~$5/month on Digital Ocean.
            - Maier wants a clear vision. Someone should write a vision for how the website should be flexible and accessible.
            - Oliver thinks we need a case study. Can we conduct some interviews with build leaders? Oliver will lead this.
    - Infrastructure Chat 43 [[March 17th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Oliver King]] [[Jenna Dixon]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Phil Wolff]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - **Agenda**
            1. Welcome/help channel.
            2. ~~Discord channel organization discussion.~~
            3. "Coffee with a Yak" infrastructure
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Phil thinks that 2/3rds of the issue is people learning Discord. So having a guided tour of some kind would be useful.
                - Phil suggested a video, possibly?
            - Some Discord-specific things:
                - How to connect to voice channels?
                - What are the difference between the voice rooms?
                - How to collapse categories?
                - Where's the interesting things?
            - Phil and Jenna both think that maybe we should break projects into internal vs. external again.
                - The idea is to help promote externally-facing projects, the creative things we want to promote.
            - Phil is interested in abandonment percentages.
                - Jenna thinks this is closer to 97%. All of the original big dogs from the original projects are gone.
            - Jenna wants to see if we want to use Knack more for projects.
                - Phil thinks that we've already got Roam, and is worried about adding a new tool.
                    - Phil's interested in using calendaring and other methods to build a public CRM in Roam. But doesn't have the time/skill themselves.
                    - Jenna would be happy to help.
            - The idea behind "Coffee with a Yak" is to have multiple properties per yak, and per "herd" (groups of yaks).
            - Nathan thinks that if we have multiple Knack apps, then:
                1. If we need logins, people should only have a single one, and
                2. If we think we want to save data long-term (by importing it to the member record mothership), we should make sure that records are associated with either an email address or a Discord [snowflake ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID) for linkability.
    - Infrastructure Chat 42 [[March 10th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Oliver King]] [[Jenna Dixon]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Phil Wolff]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Venkatesh Rao]] discussion of consistent open-source licensing policy for yc content (member contributed and 3rd party used)
            2. [[Venkatesh Rao]] financial governance/spending process
            3. [[Jenna Dixon]] softlaunch member profile portal Â» review round Â» launch
            4. [[Maier Fenster]] discuss ui for projects bot a bit more
            5. [[Maier Fenster]] should we use a calendar bot like apollo or sesh
            6. [[Nathan Acks]] Revisit third-party analytics/tracking decisions
            7. [[Oliver King]] journey (ux) diagram
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - [[Phil Wolff]] has been working on a "coffee cup" program
                - [[Nathan Acks]] isn't quite sure what this is about.
            - **User Journey UX**
                - [[Oliver King]] I just had a chat with someone who just landed on the server
                    - There were lots of channels, so a little overwhelming.
                    - Nowhere obvious to go after posting an introduction.
                    - No obvious way to detect what was happening
                - [[Oliver King]] has whipped up an onboard UX flow
                    - After someone lands on the server and they post an introduction, they should get an introductory DM
                    - Can we ping the Welcome Squad?
                    - Then folks get a more limited "base level" access... But this doesn't include projects, etc.
                        - This would be gated by some sort of "internal access" sign-up.
                    - Oliver's internal sign-up form would have a skill list.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] is concerned that gating further access could be problematic, as we have a strong "working out loud" ethos. But perhaps we could show/hide channels on demand?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] We can do this.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] This is definitely possible, but how should we make sure that channels always get roles? 
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks we should have more high-touch, in-person engagement.
                    - Also, remove the channel emoji...
                - [[Oliver King]] is reluctant to leave things to __just__ up to people.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] notes that we've gotten __really__ sloppy about roles, and cleaning this up might make things nicer for folks.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks we're probably at the point where we need to start mirroring roles from Discord into Knack.
                - [[Oliver King]] it's generally useful to have some integration.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks we should have more "short guides" than a lot of user tiers.
                - [[Oliver King]] thinks there's definitely too many channels.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that the Yak Coffee idea originated in Marketing. The idea is to translate the enthusiasm for talk among each other into actually generating __work__.
                    - [[Oliver King]] thinks this is a bit like Interintellect or Clubhouse.
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks the question for Yak Coffee is: Are we going to integrate all of this into Knack or not?
                - [[Oliver King]] thinks we should think about what channels are visible at which levels.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] and [[Phil Wolff]] __don't__ feel that there are too many channels.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] proposes that we alternately have a "mute" button.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] and [[Oliver King]] thinks this is basically just role-base access control.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] wonders __what__ problem we're trying to solve here.
                    - [[Oliver King]] notes that attention is just too defuse, especially for newcomers. By focusing attention, we can perhaps increase serendipity. People are too "bubbled" in their channels right now.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] ^^We should all think about how we want to handle channel management + introduction, and discuss this next time^^
                    1. Should we give people a tour of some kind? What should this look like?
                    2. Should we collapse down channels? Which ones? How agressively?
                    3. Should we more broadly use role-based access control to only display certain channels?
            - **Calendar Bots**
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wonders what the most effective way to set up an internal meeting is.
                    - This would work by someone telling the calendar bot to set up a meeting and invite people.
                    - It __could__ tie into Google Calendar.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] this seems duplicative with Calendly. Also, we should tie into the existing calendar system.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] asks if we have a specific use case that we can experiment on, and then how do we know if we're successful?
                    - [[Oliver King]] asks if we can use this for Yak Coffee?
                    - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that it's pretty async right now (up until it isn't).
                - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that we have some things in Yak Collective that are __really__ working. We shouldn't kill this.
                    - How Venkat-centric are we?
                    - Roam seems to be working. Discord seems to be working. Let's not put additional roadblocks here.
                - [[Oliver King]] thinks we should schedule an event to solicit general what's working/what's not working feedback.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that we should leverage existing tools, when possible.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] agrees with Phil that we should leverage existing tools and try things out first. So let's find a demo case for the calendar bots, and try it out.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wants the calendar bots to make it easier for people to talk to each other. We want to make it easier for people to set up events: Who wants to come? When can they come?
                    - We want a solution where people can both find each other, but also find times.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] notes that it may be tough to do this without contributing noise.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] and [[Phil Wolff]] will work on some ideas.
    - Infrastructure Chat 41 [[March 3rd, 2021]]
    - Infrastructure Chat 40 [[February 24th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Oliver King]] [[Phil Wolff]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] Yak Network Map
                - Vinay can't attend, but [says](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/722840198320357496/813909212878602262):
                    > I'm thinking about possible gamification around doing new yak projects with small teams of 3-6 yaks.
            2. [[Oliver King]] Yak-a-thon outreach
            3. [[Oliver King]] Permissioning for channel access
            4. [[Maier Fenster]] Should we use a dedicated calendar bot like [Apollo](https://apollo.fyi/) or [Sesh](https://sesh.fyi/)?
            5. [[Maier Fenster]] Finalize UX for Project UI bot
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - **Yak-a-thon**
                - [[Oliver King]] The point of the yakathon is self-marketing to increase internal engagement.
                    - The idea is for the welcome committee to reach out to people, get them into a member database, etc.
                    - Knack would be ideal for this.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Notes that integrating Knack into the website hasn't happened, but is on the short list.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] There are three parts to this:
                    1. Get the Knack login integrated into the website
                    2. Get people entering info in Knack
                    3. Get the website to start pulling information from Knack
                        - We probably need to be at this step to start pulling info into the Yak Network Map, etc.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] We still need a lot of glue, and the info in Knack is stale.
                    - We need to think about the user experience here.
                - [[Oliver King]] Is it possible to use Knack for input?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Yeah, IIRC Jenna suggested this.
                    - Once we have an intake form in Knack, I can drop into the website pretty fast.
                - [[Oliver King]] I'll reach out to Jenna, get this rolling.
            - **Channel Permissioning**
                - [[Oliver King]] Can we concentrate activity in fewer rooms to increase serendipity and decrease overload.
                    - The idea would be to restrict channels to opt-in only.
                    - There would be a free-for-all project incubation 
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Be aware that old-timers like Grigori and Venkat have high-level permissions, and can thus see __everything__.
                - [[Oliver King]] Something Venkat brought up was to make channel descriptions and agenda accessible through a bot
                    - So, what are the current active work streams, current agenda items, etc.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] A way of coping with scale
                - [[Oliver King]] Like an emergent memo.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I think this could get grafted into the channel/project information from the `experimental-project-ui`
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Do we want this as a DM, or do we want to add it to the channel in some way?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I think we should stay with the DM; otherwise there are going to be weird interactions.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] Could we potentially deliver this in a different channel?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Maier and I have already thought about integrating the upcoming events list into the website. We could do this here too.
                - [[Oliver King]] We should avoid having people jump between channels if possible.
                - [[Phil Wolff]] Do we have a user experience diagram that we can reference? What are we trying to accomplish?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I've never seen one.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] No.
                - [[Oliver King]] Would anyone want to work on a diagram with me?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] We should have two diagrams, one for people who haven't yet joined, and one for new/current members.
                    - We could use the `yak_shepherd` to automate a lot of this, or at least provide info.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I'll outline what the Project UI bot could DM in the `infrastructure` channel, so that people can comment.
            - **Calendar Bot**
                - [[Maier Fenster]] We added the option to use Calendly for people to set up meetings, but there's Discord-native solutions for this.
                    - Do we want to have a Discord-only flow?
                - [[Phil Wolff]] There are well-trod paths, and there are choose your own adventures, and then there's events.
                    - Where should we put a page in Roam to hold our ideas about UX?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] We don't have such a page, but if someone creates something, I'll be happy to link it to [[IT Infrastructure]]
    - Infrastructure Chat 39 [[February 17th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Jenna Dixon]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - **Agenda**
            - Bot's down...
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Looks like [[Nathan Acks]] is going to be the "emoji master" for channels.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] Discord has a 500 channel limit. We're going to run into this limit with the weekly questions in a year or four.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Maybe we should have a separate question archive.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] Even if we archive things, they'll still be marked as new, and then people need to tap on them to get them dismissed.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] Should we really remove permission to post from the archived weekly questions?
                - [[Nathan Acks]] We did have a problem with people posting to the initial archives...
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] Maybe we should leave the weekly questions up for three weeks (or something)?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] The goal was to get general discussions out of `coworking-cafe`. Questions will be rotated on Fridays.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] What if we had a "last week's questions" category that questions from the previous week?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] I can do this.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] I'd really like to revitalize the projects. [[Oliver King]]'s trying to revitalize these. Yak Rover is happening, but everything else is sleepy.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I don't have good revitalization ideas, except to make things more welcoming and more active in general, with the idea that having more active people here will lead to more project activity.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Something else is the proposed help menu. Anyone can upload to this. Links can be internal to the menu, to other Discord chats, or even off-site. Anyone can download/upload the menu.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] Who's intended to be the owner?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Whoever uploads last wins. To upload, use the Discord file upload feature, and use `$$uploadmenu` as the comment. Filename doesn't matter.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] The help channel should expose the bots, and help people learn about them.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] We should try to push the new project UI live during the call next week.

            1. [[Venkatesh Rao]] ~~discussion of consistent open-source licensing policy for yc content (member contributed and 3rd party used)~~
            2. [[Venkatesh Rao]] ~~financial governance/spending process~~

        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Dashboards!
                - The `experimental-dashboard` post gets updated every 10 minutes.
                - In `experimental-project-ui`, all the projects are listed, and by clicking on notifications people can add, leave, and get project details.
                    - Will include status information, replaces `subscribe-projects`.
                    - The "details" section would potentially be multiple lines.
                        - We'll use the channel description by default.
                    - Just walks through the "Project" group, so when we archive something it will disappear.
                    - Currently kicks off for any channel modification, will be limited to just channels in the "Project" group.
                        - Refresh will check channels every 10 minutes.
                - Assumption is that the first 10  characters of the channel name and the corresponding role match.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] reminds [[Nathan Acks]] that the primary purpose of the dashboards is to help orient new yaks.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] wants to to either use trailing emoji in channel names, or separate the leading emoji with an underscore.
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] suggests the format used by a different Discord server that has unicode mid-dots as separators. [[Nathan Acks]] really likes this.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] will play with some options, and then [[Maier Fenster]] will auto-create roles based on the channel name sans-emoji (or use existing roles when appropriate).

        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Venkatesh Rao]] ~~discussion of consistent open-source licensing policy for yc content (member contributed and 3rd party used)~~
            2. [[Venkatesh Rao]] ~~financial governance/spending process~~

            5. [[Nathan Acks]] Discuss alternate timeslots for infrastructure call
            6. [[Oliver King]] discuss project board -- logistics and feedback
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - [[Oliver King]] Had a thought about how we can increase legibility and help new Yaks figure out how to engage.
                - The idea is to create a project.
                - Venkat wants to have a firmer list for production, infrastructure, etc.
                - Oliver designed one possible approach. Grounding ideas:
                    - Constitutions & bylaws
                    - Shared values
                    - Serendipity engine (help people find each other)
                    - Fly wheel effect
                    - Repeatable units of work ("quests")
                    - Employee handbook?
            - [[Steve Lagree]] added some ideas.
                - Lots of ideas from governance. These seemed to fit into two categories:
                    - Internal growth
                        - This is more "infrastructure": Serendipity engine, fly wheel, quests, etc.
                        - These need more tools/structure/clarity.
                    - Purpose/culture/admin
                        - Constitution & bylaws, shared values, etc.
                        - This requires more discussion, potentially.
                - Roam is slow, and often doesn't load.
                    - Need things to be more visible.
            - [[Oliver King]] Maybe infrastructure could be the working group for this?
            - [[Nathan Acks]]'s head always goes to the website, and it sounds like we really do need a "member" section. Maybe something like Oliver's board could live there.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] prefers something less structured, and thinks that Discord + the website is the right place for a lot of this.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] worries that we don't have a lot of "glue" people, and hopes that perhaps what Oliver and Steve are working on could help provide that.
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] Is anything happening with an internal newsletter?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] The newsletter is waking up, but we need activity to go into the newsletter.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] All madeyaks can now tweet on the YC Twitter account directly from Discord.
                - The more tools we have to help people do things, the more things will hopefully happen.
                - We put out the survey a few weeks ago, and 50% of people didn't know how to start projects.
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] Can we get a report-back from this form?
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] is going to be practicing the multi-user Roam book club, mostly to experiment with multi-player.
                - The first book may be useful.
                - ^^Calls are almost all men. Suggests a problem we should address.^^
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] would like to do a pop-up event related to Kim Stanely Robinson's new event __The Ministry of the Future__. Where should I drop this?
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] create an event, and it will show up in the events channel.
                - [[Oliver King]] is also in the Roam book club. Maybe this could be a mini-event?
            - [[Nathan Acks]] wonders how easy it is to embed AirTable in the website.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] notes that AirTable can be integrated by iframe. There's also an embeded option, but this is only for pro users.
                    - [[Oliver King]] is on the AirTable pro plan.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] mentions that Venkat is a little worried about publicizing Roam pages, in case that invites vandalism.
            - [[Steve Lagree]] How do we start working on projects? What are quests, etc.?
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] points out that Venkat hopes that people can just show up and start doing things.
                - [[Oliver King]] the idea isn't so much to a distinct structure... But to highlight values. For example: "Show up and do things," and the quest board can provide some examples of __what__ people can do.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] the idea of a flywheel is that we need enough people doing things in public to get other people engaged and start doing things. There's just not a lot that out there in public right now. Right now, there's not a lot happening in public.
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] points out that we're sort of caught in the gap between doing project because they're fun, and actually get gigs, etc.
                    - People should join [[Grigori Milov]]'s call on Fridays.
            - [[Oliver King]] and [[Jenna Dixon]] will coordinate on a pop-up Kim Stanely Robinson event.
            - [[Oliver King]] asks that people should experiment with the AirTable quest board. We should put things onto it that we'd like to see happen.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] will take a look and add ideas.
                - [[Maier Fenster]]'s worried that this could become just a "pile of ideas". We need an organized way of talking and tracking things. This might work well for discover, but we need to filter people into more organized conversations. Maybe we should use GitHub for this.
                    - [[Steve Lagree]] agrees that we could potentially use GitHub as an issue tracker.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that perhaps we should not always use GitHub. Sometimes this should be Discord. We want to make sure we're friendly for non-techies.
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] thinks that we should spin up a Roam page per quest. And that should be the place where we have discussions.
            - ^^**Time change:** Wednesday at 15:00 UTC / 10:00 EST / 07:00 PST /  (experiment, may change depending on feedback).^^
    - Infrastructure Chat 36 [[January 24th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Maier Fenster]] allowing anybody to set up events. we can use calendly to allow anybody to set up an event which will send reminders to all and can also be rescheduled, etc.
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - [[Maier Fenster]] wants to get feedback on Calendly for launch.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that things looks good, but would strip out the "Calendly standard" info from the Discord announcements in `#events`
                    - Basically, everything before the "Location" line.
                    - The "Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting" prefix.
                    - The "Need to make changes to this event" line and everything after (in particular, the cancel/reschedule links).
                - [[Maier Fenster]] agrees.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] is still disengaged, but is hopeful that maybe re-engagement with YC projects will happen next week. Aiming for a ~4hr/week time commitment moving forward.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that we need to get more people involved with the website and other infrastructure projects.
    - Infrastructure Chat 35 [[January 10th, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - location:: https://meet.google.com/zfc-qhjy-oey
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Infrastructure calls seems to be just [[Nathan Acks]] and [[Maier Fenster]] now...
            - We really need to make things more lively... This is why Calendly is important.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] will bump this up for the next thing they do today (after finishing up with the channels).
                - [[Nathan Acks]] doesn't feel like they're in much of a troubleshooting headspace right now, unfortunately.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks we need a better process for getting buy-in around things.
                - All [[Nathan Acks]] can think of is posting something in `#announcements`, but neither [[Nathan Acks]] nor [[Maier Fenster]] like this idea.
                - The goal here is not just feedback, but __ownership__ -- a sense of "this is mine".
                    - [[Maier Fenster]]: "The Yak Collective is a place for doing, not a place for believing".
                - For example, how do we make [[Paul Sas]]'s "ask me anything" happen?
                - What is something that makes people want to spend their free time on the Yak Collective?
                    - One issue: Someone spending a time writing a story doesn't look very active on Discord, even if they're spending a lot of time doing YC-related activities.
                    - Another example: Coworking Cafe is just the same 10-ish people...
                    - We used to have some channels that were more member/project oriented ("give feedback on my slide deck"), but these have faded.
                        - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that the reason this hasn't worked so well is that we haven't had wranglers.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] sees YC as project-oriented. [[Maier Fenster]]'s more interested in discussions.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]]'s not sure the project-based model is proving sustainable.
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] points out that projects __are__ good for sustaining smaller communities.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]]'s not sure that the smaller communities are sustainable without a broader pool of engaged-ish people on Discord (or wherever) to draw from.
    - Infrastructure Chat 34 [[January 3rd, 2021]]
        - participants:: [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - location:: https://meet.google.com/zfc-qhjy-oey
        - **Agenda**
            - [[Maier Fenster]] Allowing anybody to set up events. We can use Calendly to allow anybody to set up an event which will send reminders to all and can also be rescheduled, etc.
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - [[Grigori Milov]] is concerned that the YC is too top-down.
                - [[Hugo Macedo]] suggested we use Calendly, since that would allow for anyone to set up a meeting, but still restrict editing to the meeting creator.
                - Calendly hooks into Google Calendar, and allows meetings to be scheduled/rescheduled within meeting windows (so that they don't conflict).
                    - Meeting topics can be set, but creator name is present.
                - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] isn't sure what this brings to our existing setup.
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] points out that this allows us to graft event-level permissions into Google Calendar.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that this does feel more consistent with our philosophy.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] will set this up next weekend (negative check-off in the infrastructure channel).
            - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] wants to get people involved in Yak Map based discussions.
                - What's the best way to get people involved?
                - Maybe just reach out by DM initially?
                - The trick is to see where things go, as it's hard to predict where conversations will go.
                - Is there a way to integrate this into onboarding?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] is reluctant to integrate this initially, but rather introduce people after they've been fully onboarded.
                    - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] is looking for something like the onboarding process under discussion, but for existing members.
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks we need some use-cases initially, and then we can riff off of people's initial (manual) experiences.
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] wonders what the infrastructure would look like long-term.
                        - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that a bot hooked into Knack would be the best direction.
                        - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] points out that we can also use recent channel data on Discord.
                - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] is thinking about creating a pseudo-project page on Roam.
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks that a project proposal is maybe too formal -- just do conversations.
                        - [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] thinks it's important to have someone establish some initial flows.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks that the biggest infrastructure thing we can do right now to move this forward is helping to QA Knack.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] will look into turning the Yak Map integration into an iframe widget + Git submodule.
    - Infrastructure Chat 33 [[December 27th, 2020]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Nathan Acks]] [[Praful Mathur]]
        - location:: https://meet.google.com/zfc-qhjy-oey
        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Nathan Acks]] Discuss/finalize discord channel lifecycle.
            2. [[Praful Mathur]] Newsletter infrastructure
            3. ~~Discuss UI for projects bot a bit more.~~
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - [[Maier Fenster]] thinks we should group project channels by state.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] will finalize the [[Discord Channel Lifecycle and Organization]] proposal and then give people a one-week negative check-off
            - [[Praful Mathur]] Newsletter gets put together every other Wednesdays
                - Content depends on what's available right now.
                - Ideally, we'd be describing what's happening within YC
                    - What projects are where?
                    - What gigs are available?
                    - Who needs help?
                - The idea is to become a bit of a view into what the YC needs right now.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] We need to gather information, and then get it to Praful.
                - There's bots already for help wanted, gigs, and a newsletter bot.
                - We don't have a project summary/update bot.
                - At the moment, most of our project management happens in Roam, but there's no good API.
                - We could DM people every couple of weeks right now.
                - There's also the agenda bots.
                    - Marketing and Infrastructure use the agenda bot the most.
            - [[Praful Mathur]] Can I get help on the bots?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Just DM `$help` to `gigayak`.
                    - Discord has slash commands, but the Python library Maier's using doesn't support these yet.
                    - There may be a way to integrate things, but Maier just learned about this recently.
            - [[Praful Mathur]] `$agendalist` and `$giglist` should be useful.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] We need to start normalizing people using these bots. Maybe we can push this through the newsletter?
                - [[Praful Mathur]] Yes.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] The idea is that "gigs" pay, while "help wanted" are more volunteer-ish opportunities within YC.
                - Venkat doesn't see gigs is a big thing.
            - [[Praful Mathur]] When I talk to people, they're much more interested in using YC to find gigs and extend their work by leveraging YC resources.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] The problem seems to be popularizing the newsletter and gig bots.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] I think we need to just keep publicly demonstrating this ourselves.
            - [[Nathan Acks]] will follow up with contributors from __Astonishing Stories__ and __Future Frontiers__ about RSS feeds.
            - [[Praful Mathur]] Gigs, help wanted, upcoming events, newletter items list will be the most useful
                - Longer term, if we have a bot that can ping project managers for updates, that would be useful.
            - Newsletter options: Substack, Ghost, Buttondown
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Buttondown has a read/write API so we can programmatically build newsletters, but that's $29/month.
                    - Buttondown also allows us to add a "subscribe to our newsletter" box to the website.
                    - If we're going to self-host, we should steer away from self-hosting.
                - [[Praful Mathur]] Folks would prefer a Google Doc. But Buttondown looks like it has __really__ good analytics -- better than Substack or Ghost.
                    - Praful will play around with Ghost and Buttondown, see if it makes sense for us to move.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] We can add a command to the relevant bots to dump information to a Google Doc and then provide a link back.
    - Infrastructure Chat 32 [[December 20th, 2020]]
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Jordan Peacock]] [[Nathan Acks]]
        - location:: https://meet.google.com/zfc-qhjy-oey
        - **Agenda**
            1. [[Nathan Acks]] Discuss/Finalize the [[Discord Channel Lifecycle and Organization]] proposal.
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Maybe we want to use something that mirrors [Jordan's channels role](https://www.notion.so/Yak-Collective-Reaction-Roles-09be0f1e7e4f492ba1cf5604a600c31d)?
                - So, one idea is just to bind everything to roles.
                - If these roles show/hide channels, then the internal/external breakdown isn't as relevant.
            - Three ways to maybe interact with projects:
                - Jordan's emoji describer
                - Subscribe to channels directly
                - Some kind of bot that looks at channels under "Internal|External Projects" and then replies with stats, descriptions, etc.
            - Admins have access to carl.gg using their Discord credentials
                - Jordan thinks we should be able to implement all of our onboarding ideas using carl.gg
            - We should put Jordan's `#subscribe-projects` channel in "Plaza"
            - Example onboarding: https://discord.com/invite/tUNk5huE
            - Nathan wonders if we can't just have a "concierge yak" (really, yak_shepherd) open a DM immediately when someone joins, and then handle onboarding and offer to let people join projects.
            - Maier suggests that maybe each project should be its own message in `#subscribe-projects`, with reactions to indicate subscribe/unsubscribe.
                - Jordan thinks that this is doable.
            - Proposal changes:
                - Leave system messages on, but disable joins
                - Move system messages to `#announcements`
                - Archive `#general`
                - Update the proposal to just list projects under "Projects"
                    - Hide channels if you don't have a role

        - 11:30:: [[Yak Collective]] infrastructure call #Meetings
        - participants:: [[Maier Fenster]] [[Erik Sandberg]] [[Darren Kong]]
        - location:: https://meet.google.com/zfc-qhjy-oey
        - **Agenda**
            1. Discussion of consistent open-source licensing policy for Yak Collective content (member contributed and 3rd party used).
            2. Financial governance/spending process.
        - **Meeting Notes**
            - Maier's going to talk to Praful about how to apply bots to the newsletter.
            - Praful and Maier are also thinking through Tom Critchlow's "thinking in public".
            - Nathan need to fix the infrastructure diagram: The "Calendar Yak" is using the Google Calendar API, rather than Gmail
            - Maier thinks that project licensing is more of a governance issue.
                - There's two issues here... Entire projects vs. individual content.
            - Maier is fond of MIT licensing for code. Nathan agrees.
            - We probably need to have per-project licensing.
                - Should be easy enough to include a licensing attribute to pages/projects on the Yak Collective website
                    - We should probably also add a licensing field to the Yak Collective project template in Roam
                - We should ping Discord about whether the current agenda items make sense for the "infrastructure" channel
                    - Darren points out that governance should make a decision, and then infrastructure should implement
            - Darren wonders how we want to run an eCommerce store.
                - Nathan has experience with Shopify and thinks that we should use something like this rather than integrating anything into the website.
                - Erik points out that you need a business account to use Shopify, so there's governance issues here too.
                - Maier points out that Shreeda was asking if it makes sense to run a Kickstarter for Venkat's "quadrology" card game idea.
                    - Darren had a similar idea, but was thinking of running it through their own personal LLC.
                    - Erik seems a little wary about doing this without some sort of more formal bank account structure, etc.
                - Maier wonders if we can be more of a "storefront" where individual projects were hosted.
                - Nathan thinks that there are two parts to what we're thinking of:
                    - Website implementation. Widget + some front matter.
                    - Accounting. Probably needs to be a Google Sheet, rather than done in Roam.
                - Erik points out that we need to think through expectations (more governance). There may be automation/APIs we could leverage here. Lots of "what do the users need" kind of questions.
            - Lots of conversation about a project involving creating an [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies)-like card game

                - proposal
        - [[Nathan Acks]]'s notes
            - participants:: [[Darren Kong]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Hershil Patel]]
            - I'm wondering if we had a particular format we wanted to use for the general meeting.
                - Darren will go over the infrastructure map.
                - I will talk about the website, how it's going, the movement to Knack.
                - Maier will talk about automation.
            - [[Maier Fenster]]: Automation!
                - Current bots (all have a `$help` function)
                    - `yak_scraper` is a general helper robot. Kinda a swiss army knife.
                        - Gives help to new members
                        - Lists new members
                        - Lists channel activity
                        - Lists member activity
                        - Helps yaks meet each other by finding intro messages
                    - `gigayak` is a helper robot for `yak_scraper`
                        - Handles adding and dropping open gigs
                        - Also handles adding agenda items __per channel__
                        - Also handles project upvoting, etc.
                - Darren suggests that we could also add "agenda items" to the newsletter through a bot.
                    - Maier will follow up with Praful about the Newsletter.
                - Maybe we should also have a "help wanted" bot for internal projects that could use assistance?
                    - General consensus seems to be that a help wanted bot may be useful.
                - Darren thinks that the newsletter may become just a compilation of bot output.
                - Nathan: Everyone on this call, and maybe some of our higher-volume contributors, should publicly use these bots. Normalize/model them.
            - [[Darren Kong]]: Do we want to be a community server?
                - [Community servers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server) require us to explicitly add moderators, community guidelines, etc.
                - There's an analytics feature we get if we turn into this.
                - Nathan: I know that there have been some push-back around explicit guidelines.
                - Darren: We can probably just cut-and-paste some kind of standard-ish open source "human decency" guidelines.
                - Maier: There's no call to action right now.
                    - Darren: I'll post something.
            - [[Darren Kong]]: Do we want to talk about Venkat's project proposal?
                - Maier: I think that this is the reason for the bots.
            - [[Darren Kong]] will take over shepherding [the channel proposal](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/0EQra2bCr) from [[Nathan Acks]].
    - infrastructure chat 27 [[November 15th, 2020]] #meeting-notes
        - Darren's notes
            - change meeting time?
            - web updates
                - [[Palash]] - set up... documentation isn't great, but community comments are great.
                - potential of switching to Gatsby. Hugo - templating is faster than Liquid. 
                - Gatsby block quotes
                - Bandwidth-constrained experience of our website 
                - Knack for 3rd party auth 
            - yak scraper
                - [[Maier Fenster]] added message and mention aggregation by week 
                - $activity 60 code
        - Nathan's notes
            - [[Palash]] is porting the site to Gatsby!
                - The Gatsby documents are __really__ bad.
                - A lot of community problems. But a __big__, and a good community.
                - Can render MDX components in Netlify CMS.
                - Palash is going to reimplement the existing site in Gatsby.
                - NPM packages can be imported into Gatsby during build time, as plugins. So, builds can make whatever API calls we need.
                - Palash thinks that components that animate as one scrolls is easy to implement in Gatsby. [[Sachin Benny]] should be excited about this.
                - Palash is taking a couple of days off, and then needs to figure out some build problems. Should have a more concrete demo in 1 - 2 weeks.
                - Current fork: https://goofy-agnesi-5c224c.netlify.app/
                - On performance: Some blocking is actually good, because it can give resources time to load.
                - There's a CSS property called `font-display` that will block the browser on load.
                    - https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-display/
                - What's the right priority here?
                    - Nathan thinks: Get a POC working, then get all the functionality working, then add in nice editing.
                        - We should be thinking about file structure during the first two phases.
                - Palash will be looking at alternate CMSes as well, but Netlify CMS has the capability to render MDX widgets, and is the right price.
                    - Maier: If we can use Discord as our central authentication.
                    - Palash: If we're interested in self-hosted, [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is good
                - Maier: Is there an ability to have a drag-and-drop interface in Netlify CMS?
                    - Palash: Netlify is building something, but it's not ready yet.
                - Maier: 25% - 35% of our website access is mobile.
            - Changing times (Maier/Darren)
                - There's a 13.5 hour difference between call participants, but Palash's schedule is shifting, so no change to times right now...
                - We should revisit this in the January time frame.
            - Channel usage tool (Maier)
                - `yak_scraper` now gives channel activity information
                - Also shows how many messages and mentions per week
                    - The idea is that channels where people mention each other more are more social.
                - Nathan: We should have some sort of notification that "`yak_scraper` is working"
                    - Maier: We can send a "typing" notification
                - Maier: We definitely need to move forward with some kind of channel archiving/lifecycle proposal
                - Maier: Some of these channels should really be Roam pages
                    - Nathan: It would be great if we had an easier way to share Roam links
                    - Maier: I have a (private) extension that unfurls links using my server
                        - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ruf/ahjankgnkfhcpemcahifhalkfapojekc
                - ^^Nathan: I will repost my simplify/lifecycle proposal.^^
                    - [[Discord Channel Lifecycle and Organization]]
            - Discord map [[Maier Fenster]]
                - Maier: I'd really like a visual map of the Discord server, but we should have a metaphor.
                    - Maybe make it dynamic using the data from `yak_scraper`.
                - ^^Maier: Can [[Darren Kong]] and [[Nathan Acks]] think of visual metaphors?^^

            - yak map
        - [[Nathan Acks]] notes
            - Channels (Darren)
                - Darren: Provisional channels are going well. Should we promote them?
                - Maier: How are channels normally handled?
                - Darren: We have more channels, and more specific channels, than more. Our users are also generally less sophisticated.
                - Maier: I would wait two week, and then promote things that are still active.
                - Darren: Any other criteria? One post per day?
                - Nathan: Sometimes channels can skip a day. I'd do something more like 5 - 10 a week.
                - Maier: We should have a dashboard (posts per day, new people, etc.), and then make a decision.
                - Nathan: I'd go to for something simpler with a defined lifecycle.
                - Darren: Mix probationary and archive? Like levels?
                - Maier: I don't want to mix the babies and dying channels.
                - Nathan: What about resurrected channels?
                - Maier: No opinions.
                - Darren: I can write some proposed criteria.
                - Nathan: I can write up a lifecycle proposal. We should coordinate.
                - Darren: General is pretty dead.
                - Nathan: Why don't we post Events in General?
                - Darren: No reason.
                - Maier: We should have a (text) map of channels.
                - Vinay: I like this idea. Can this maybe be combined with the Yak Map? This might be too complicated.
                - Maier: We are building a capability to pre-launch channel recommendations. We can also output a list of active channels (once we start monitoring channels). We could also have a tool that looks for keywords.
                - Vinay: We definitely need some new tools. Maybe we could prioritize this list?
                - Nathan: Is there a way to tag channels?
                - Maier: We'd need to write a custom system to do this. But I'd recommend we just build this "tag/word cloud" automatically.
                - Nathan: This goes back to an idea we've periodically kicked around. "Here's the top 5 most active channels this past week," etc. I think there are three points here:
                    - When do we archive/promote channels?
                    - How do we better organize/consolidate channels?
                    - How do we increase channel discoverability?
                - Vinay: I think discoverability is very connected to promotion and archiving.
            - Types of members (Maier)
                - Maier: Right now we have several types of members, but we need better definitions. Then we need to map these levels to who __can__ be in Vinay's map.
                    - Not members
                    - Yaks
                    - Made yaks
                    - Kicked out (because they haven't done anything)
                - Nathan: I don't have opinions.
                - Maier: We just someone to make a decision. These are the types, these are the people on the website, these are the people in the Yak Map. (Also, I don't think we're actually kicking people off right now.)
                - Vinay: I think it goes...
                    - Yaks (everyone in Discord)
                    - Active yaks (people with an intro, can be in Network Map)
                    - Made yak (public project participation, on website, can be in Network Map)
                    - Yak shaver (admin people)
                - Vinay: Just post a suggestion in Infrastructure.
                - Nathan: I will just write up something.
            - Testing and deployment (Maier)
                - Maier: What is our standard for launching things?
                - Nathan: I just ping the infrastructure channel a few days to a week ahead of time.
                - Maier: We need some kind of semi-official second pair of eyes.
                - Vinay: You should write something up, and send it to Nathan. We probably need one or more QA people, maybe someone who is outside of the infrastructure group, or at least someone who's more of a "normal" user.
                - Nathan: We already have a semi-formal project review process.
                - Maier: So, we should have a Roam page for every infrastructure project. We'd need a checklist for each release with a formal sign-off (doesn't need to be the same reviewer/QA person as listed on the Roam page).
                - Nathan: So, there needs to be a checklist for each project, but it won't necessarily be the same checklist for each project. I don't want to write this, but Maier's right.
                - Vinay: I think checklists already exist.
                - Nathan: Whoever runs the project should write up the page. I will roll mine in with the rest of the documentation updates, so I might be late to the party.
            - Update on the Network Map (Vinay)
                - Vinay: Going to add some simple documentation + a guide on how to use. Then do a simple demo for people, and then next week have a discussion on this call about how best to integrate this into the website.
                - Nathan: Are changes just JavaScript + JSON, or does it involve HTML changes?
                - Vinay: Using a plug-in to generate things. Just JSON changes.
                - Maier: We could do this with an iframe?
                - Nathan: Theoretically, yes, but I'd rather not if we don't have to.
                - Vinay: Version 1.0 is ready, we just need to get people's impressions now, and see if this is worthwhile to folks. Focused on this in the next month.
                - Nathan: I'll drop in the new JSON.

        - Notes by [[Nathan Acks]]
            - [[Yak Collective State of the Union]]
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - Venkat thinks we should do something at the end of the year
                    - Maybe do a Doodle to identify a couple of good dates in December
                    - Opportunity to reset state
                    - What's everyone's projects? General updates?
                    - We need:
                        - A date
                        - A commitment from people leading projects to do a presentation/pitch
                            - What have we been doing?
                            - What do we need for support?
                            - What opportunities?
                    - Jenna's been maintaining a Kanban board of various projects
                - [[Maier Fenster]] Would this be a format that other people could use?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] This would be more like a general meeting. Something high enough stakes to get everyone excited. We should do something like this once a year.
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} I need to take a look at Jenna's project Kanban board
                - [[Maier Fenster]] We need to cover the whole infrastructure map.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] More people seem to be engaged in infrastructure, but this is inward looking
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - We should have all projects present. If someone doesn't present, it's not happening
                    - Half "what's happening", half "open ended discussion about what we need"
                    - Venkat will organize
                - [[Maier Fenster]] How long? Two or three hours?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] That would be ambitious. __Maybe__ two hours with 12 people presenting
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - We should advertise this on the newsletter. Will also advertise on Ribbonfarm.
                    - This will be an open meeting. No need to be a member.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] I'd suggest using Zoom -- Discord doesn't seem to work well for large meetings.
            - AMA format/feedback (Darren)
                - [[Darren Kong]] Do we want more interactive activities? This might give us more fodder for content.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] I like this idea. We could have AMAs for individual Yak Collective members.
                - [[Darren Kong]]
                    - The newsletter folks originally were prompting for more content.
                    - We could go back to the project leads, we could do random folks.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] Internally-facing content is boring for outsiders. We should focus on externally-facing content.
                - [[Darren Kong]] The idea would be to focus on folks' indie background.
                    - If this seems worthwhile, Darren will run.
                    - More worthwhile if we can push content into the newsletter, etc.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] There was an idea in the marketing channel -- "how did we build this?"
                    - Focus on practical outcomes. What makes our prospective clients interested in us?
                    - Sort of a "real stories" from the trenches things. Less "what can I do", and more "here's how I did X"
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Have we coordinated with the newsletter folks?
                - [[Sachin Benny]] Right now, only Praful is working on this.
                    - ^^(Seems like the newsletter folks may need some help)^^
                - [[Darren Kong]] I will reach out
            - Prototype shepherd bot (Maier)
                - [[Maier Fenster]]
                    - The shepherd robot is currently in a [private repo](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/onboarding_robot) until we're confident in our security model.
                    - Robot runs on a server that Maier maintains. This allows for the robots to run and respond continuously.
                    - People can work on robots without logging onto the server -- there's a script that pushes new/updated robots to the server.
                    - Right now we have one robot, which pulls data for the `yak_scraper` -- Discord UID, join date, etc.
                    - Discord robots are easy -- generate a key, and then Discord will push events to the robot's web hook.
                    - If you write `$hello`, the robot will answer.
                    - Only Maier can kill the robot right now.
                    - There are options for more sophisticated commands.
                        - We could talk to Knack, the Roam API.
                        - Soon, it should show calendar reminders.
                        - Can potentially send project updates.
                    - The "shepherd' robot keeps track of new yaks via states. When a yak enters a state, a specified internal function is run.
                        - Currently, watches for introductions and promotes people who've done this into full yaks. It then sends a thank-you DM.
                        - If you don't send an introduction, it reminds you periodically.
                        - If you haven't posted an introduction in 7 days, the shepherd kicks you out o the server.
                        - Additional onboarding logic can be fairly easily added when/if we decide to do this.
                    - Yaks can be in multiple states -- for example, running a project, and also still receiving introductory turorials.
                    - Maier can provide fuller tutorials for folks who want to extend this.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - Venkat wants to zero out finances by the end of the year, so we can definitely pay for this server.
                    - How many people actually understand the infrastructure?
                - [[Maier Fenster]]
                    - We should move the server over to the Yak Collective robot.
                    - In general, we're trying to document things so that people can pick things up, but also to build user-friendly "APIs" for less technical folks.
                - [[Nathan Acks]]
                    - We have a general problem in that nobody really has their head around all of our infrastructure.
                    - Documentation in Roam is being kept up-to-date as well as possible, but is known to have missing/inaccurate bits.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] Long-term, custom infrastructure has a better chance of surviving when exposed as open source projects
                - [[Maier Fenster]] There should always be multiple people who knows what's going on for a given project
            - Proto-project channels (Maier)
                - [[Maier Fenster]]
                    - Projects need channels before they're projects -- a place where people can discuss whether they __want__ an idea to become a project
                    - Current channel policy doesn't seem to work well
                    - Maybe we want an "embryonic channels" group
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - The "Collaborations" channel is supposed to serve this function, but it's not that clear. We should clean this up.
                    - We __do__ have an "infrastructure" channel
                - [[Maier Fenster]] A single channel may not be good -- people need a space to talk.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] We should have an "experimental" category with a really low create/destroy threshold.
                - [[Grigori Milov]]
                    - The "pie slices" folks seem to have already nucleated, and there's a request in create/destroy channels already.
                    - Maybe we should just let people figure out how to coordinate, rather than perscribing something.
                - [[Darren Kong]] We should do a sweep of all channels... We kind of have too many right now.
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - We need to prevent channel proliferation.
                    - Maybe require a sandbox channel. Keep things open.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] New category for experimental channels, with "pie slicing" the first one.
                - [[Grigori Milov]] Agreed.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] will set up a new category ("probationary channels" or some such)
                - [[Darren Kong]] Maybe we should put potentially dead channels there?
                - [[Maier Fenster]] I can grab channel stats with the website
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] That would be something cool to see on the website.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] I have something like this already, but would need to be adapted for the website.
    - Infrastructure Chat 24 [[October 25th, 2020]] #meeting-notes
        - Attendees: [[Nathan Acks]] [[Sachin Benny]] [[Maier Fenster]] [[Paul Sas]] [[Kacper Wikiel]]
        - Walked through website changes related to [[Astonishing Stories]]
            - These are temporary -- [[Nathan Acks]] is working on a new "widgetized" back end. Aiming to go live on [[October 30th, 2020]]
                - Project headers, Google slide shows, lists of writings, member cards, images, and more are now includable widgets
                - Future website pages will not be constrained to a particular layout
                - Some tweaks, like image positioning and fine-grained placement, still require CSS. Some "advanced" widgets will require knowledge of Liquid. But the goal is that people can build a good-looking page without knowing CSS or HTML or Liquid at all.
                - Documentation will be on Roam + a set of template pages that can be used as reference/starter pages
                - [[Maier Fenster]] calls this a "design language"
                    - Also: Should we revisit the existing website milestones? They don't seem as applicable anymore...
        - Talked about building ebooks as part of the publishing flow
            - [[Nathan Acks]] thinks we can do something quick-and-dirty using Pandoc
                - https://pandoc.org/epub.html
            - [[Maier Fenster]] suggests building the ePub file first, and then using an in-page ePub viewer
                - https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/
            - Another possibility: Use two different site generators, one for the main body of the website, and another to build "subsites" like [[Astonishing Stories]] + relevant ebook
        - [[Sachin Benny]] points out that we still don't have Google Analytics access. [[Nathan Acks]] will follow up with [[Tom Critchlow]].
            - Worst-case scenario, we just call old data a loss and spin up a new account.
        - Long-term, move some IFTTT automation into GitHub using Actionflow
            - https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow
            - [[Maier Fenster]] points out that this doesn't roll in the Google Calendar to [[Discord]] connector currently powered by [[Zapier]]
                - Best idea seems to be to use the server Maier's built the `yak_scraper` bot on
                - We'll need [[Venkatesh Rao]] to add a new A record pointing to this server. Maybe hook it into `robot.yakcollective.org`?

    - Infrastructure Chat 21 [[October 4th, 2020]] #meeting-notes
        - participants:: [[Nathan Acks]] | [[Maier Fenster]] | [[Hershil Patel]] | [[Jenna Dixon]] | [[Vinay DÃ©brou]]
        - Jenna has integrated the Yak Map questions into Knack.
            - So, the idea is to drive the Yak Map first, and __then__ create an account if that makes sense.
        - YakTalk is burned out. Too intense to produce.
            - Needs to be reconstituted.
        - Maier proposes "Yak Orbits" based upon [[Vaugh Tan]]'s work.
            - Maier's idea is to present this as a non-editable field.
            - Jenna thinks this assignable on the back end.
                - to display or not to display, on member profile #openquestion
            - This would be an additional number, in addition to the Discord level and heat map.
        - The idea is to use Vinay's Yak Map project to jumpstart data entry here.
            - Current conceptual levels (via Vinay):
                - Yaks (posted info)
                - Active Yaks (participating in any form)
                    - Project Participants
                - Made Yaks (actually named in projects)
        - UID issues
            - Maier suggests we use the 15 digit Discord UID
                - General agreement that this is the way to go.
            - Vinay's using Discord username
        - Maier proposes that we push people from Discord -> Knack as part of onboarding
        - Jenna thinks we have Yak Map questions __first__ in Knack
            - Knack can send out welcome emails.
                - But Discord won't provide these (see below).
            - Vinay will send Jenna the initial scraped CSV. This CSV has the Discord UID.
                - [[October 5th, 2020]] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPpiOm17In1ZLQqcNeVh4lVc-7T21dOdtZ8zPOm9ONA/edit?usp=sharing
        - Maier points out that Discord only provides UID, username, and role
            - We can bootstrap these comms using Maier's `yak_scraper` robot
            - For the moment, we'll just DM people; later, we __may__ add interactivity.

                        - We need a Start Here that presents different ways to get into - different profiles will follow different paths, although we may recommend one - by [[Hugo Macedo]] 
                            - what's a successful onboarding: 
                                - {{[[DONE]]}} Profile created
                                - {{[[DONE]]}} joined discord

                            - What's the "minimum viable interaction" you need to feel included/part of? 
assume that you can't know/digest everything at once - YC is a complex and labyrintic  mansion just pick a small "room"
                        - Way for members to get announcements or updates from projects
                - internal fields for project contributions -> display member page 
        - updated infrastructure map 
        - discord python library - discord onboarding experience or analytics - no update

                    - decision
                - get a few stories drafted by Tues/Wed and edit Wed/Thurs ... send out on Fridays
                    - have less intensity around requiring every track to be represented
            - automate the production of yak talk more... center it more around project updates w/ editors providing commentary? 
                - project updates, analytics -> aggregated for newsletter
                    - update could be knack form
                        -  single place to update would be great. instead of discord, email, call...
            - content in some ways can actually detract from figuring out what's going on in yak collective
            - possibility of using another tool besides substack like buttondown

                - knack vs google form? 
                    - allowing members to change data in knack with the rest of their profile... could be a separate section 
                        - GDPR
                        - can pull in the data via the API 
                    - although updates don't HAVE to be real-time
                - are there fields that we want to add? 
                - bio cards
                    - iframe?
