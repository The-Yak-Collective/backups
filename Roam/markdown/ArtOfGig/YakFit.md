- ## fitness-health as infinite game 
- playing the long game yak-style original post on discord
    - > I occasionally still muse on what a yakfit project could be too. Primal movement stuff like your Strength Side guys… who basically scare me as having unattainable looks for normies and who also don’t actually move that well (acknowledging self as movement snob)
    - > https://youtu.be/DZPvK1MWGdg
    - > and MovNat, Ido Portal, Katie Bowman (“movement snacks” ftw), MovementbyDavid, Hybrid Calisthenics, and Original Strength (tx @Matthew Sweet (UTC) for that rec)
    - > … but maybe the deeper traditions of like Shi Heng Yi who has the Strength Side guys’ look but for realz, really curious what allowed him to share what he does since my martial arts instructors talked a lot about how all the real stuff was village-secret level for most of all time + in the Chinese traditions all the people who really knew something died or were killed in the cultural revolution 
    - > eg this bone marrow washing vid…
    - > https://youtu.be/Jz7MNKX63sI
    - >  ... or his fundamentals of qigong series

    - > The big divide for me is around fitness-for-what: high level sports and endurance stuff v playing the long game. Used to do the former, kinda forced into the latter now so have to be pretty strategic. Also no more “workout” thinking, move more all through the day is where it’s at for buttjobs. Known paradox: If your work is on your feet, there’s nothing like the moment when you get to take a seat. If your work is stationary, nothing like the moment when you get to stride out.

- ### experiment | ideas with reasonable science behind them
- > You’ll have more energy and focus during the daytime to get work done if you get better sleep. It’s a vicious cycle. Start one step at a time. Turn the phone off and put it in another room 1-2 hours before bed, then in a week or two, do the same with the laptop. Take it as gradually as you need to, but you can do it. Easy. —grimhood

- Heinlein quote
    - > “A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” ― Robert A. Heinlein
