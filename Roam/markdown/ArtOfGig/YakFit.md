        - > I occasionally still muse on what a yakfit project could be too. Primal movement stuff like your Strength Side guys… who basically scare me as having unattainable looks for normies and who also don’t actually move that well (acknowledging self as movement snob)
        - > https://youtu.be/DZPvK1MWGdg
        - > and MovNat, Ido Portal, Katie Bowman (“movement snacks” ftw), MovementbyDavid, Hybrid Calisthenics, and Original Strength (tx @Matthew Sweet (UTC) for that rec)
        - > … but maybe the deeper traditions of like Shi Heng Yi who has the Strength Side guys’ look but for realz, really curious what allowed him to share what he does since my martial arts instructors talked a lot about how all the real stuff was village-secret level for most of all time + in the Chinese traditions all the people who really knew something died or were killed in the cultural revolution 
        - > eg this bone marrow washing vid…
        - > https://youtu.be/Jz7MNKX63sI

        - > The big divide for me is around fitness-for-what: high level sports and endurance stuff v playing the long game. Used to do the former, kinda forced into the latter now so have to be pretty strategic. Also no more “workout” thinking, move more all through the day is where it’s at for buttjobs. Known paradox: If your work is on your feet, there’s nothing like the moment when you get to take a seat. If your work is stationary, nothing like the moment when you get to stride out. 
- `infinitness` `infitness`
- ## Experiment | ideas with reasonable science behind them
- Thinking siderail for YakCon On. Include in the short intros round, not a track. 
- BASF ads as model... "We don't make the thing, we make it better." A yakfit pitch along that line. A baseline of fitness that makes everything else better.

- DIY structure, could be a thread on the yakfit channel. 
- > You’ll have more energy and focus during the daytime to get work done if you get better sleep. It’s a vicious cycle. Start one step at a time. Turn the phone off and put it in another room 1-2 hours before bed, then in a week or two, do the same with the laptop. Take it as gradually as you need to, but you can do it. Easy. —grimhood
- > In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.

            - > Most days, I move first thing in the morning. I walk with a friend, so that my “movement time” is also my “coffee with a friend” date. Stacking my life this way, getting movement and something else I need/love to do, is key to fitting it all in. I always wear minimal shoes. A wide, flexible, and totally flat shoe means when I move, more of me is moving! At home, our family uses low tables and the floor instead of sitting in couches and chairs. When I am working, I have a dynamic workstation (I don’t work in the same position all the time), and I take movement breaks at my desk. While I am home, I use objects in and around my home to facilitate movement and I break up my workday with chores. Also, I take calls and do errands on foot, often at the same time. The bulk of our family time (before and after school, weekends, holidays) is spent outside, moving. We typically walk wherever we go—if we’re not going to walk the whole way there, then we park at a distance and walk the rest of the way.
