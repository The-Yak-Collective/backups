- Eric: All the problems we have are actual problems on mars missions
- Maier: Just a few hours ago everything was good... on "earth" (Tokyo in evening) everything was fine, but on "mars" (Tokyo at night) things broke
- James: lag is a big deal and perspective matters a lot
- Sai: should have more abstract commands, accounting for the lag
- Maier -- what commands get it stuck?
    - Anuraj -- when the "drone" feed was there, it was easier
- Sai -- I could orient myself to the rover POV
- Venkat: design and build challenges show up in live demos
- Maier -- LRA had a bias, veers to the left. Helping the bot's own model of itself adjust to changes in its body. 
- Sai -- this is what I'm working on... RL for hand robotics
- Venkat -- 2 levels of feedback, goal-level abstraction vs. low-level regulation
- Sai -- CLIP, natural language as command
- Points from new participants
    - How to get in...
    - James and Brian... big exposure to what we don't know we don't know
    - Venkat... trying to do a whole build as a starting out
    - Maier -- how to get to social robotics via doing/trial-and-error discovery
    - Phil -- self-awareness: digital twins that model the abilities of sensors/actuators, allowing: simulation for low-level planning; gap analysis for the difference between what is seen/felt/done and the model to adjust the model toward reality; to enable abstractions shared among bots/services. 
    - Phil: Charging/repowering yourself leads to fintech (paying for power) and trusted identity. 
- Nalini
    - publish capabilities as a way to mitigate intermittent comms
    - systems engineering side of project
- Meta: 
    - Learning what you don't know.  
    - Did the learning process work as you expected? 
    - Is there structured knowledge that could build your competencies faster? 
- Discussion on convergence
- Ecosystem/capability development
- OpenROV style build, but also the tools/pieces to reuse
