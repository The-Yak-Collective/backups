                - There are several Roam pages
                    - Here is the main [Roam page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/QmE-vAzPn).
                    - Everybody planning a build should create a build page under the [2021 Builds](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/LCH9VzUXa) page.
                    - Here is a [References page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/DUQgrnzRl)
            - You can always get the current agenda in the Discord channel using the command **$agendalist**. You can add items using the command **$agendaadd** with item details in the channel. Today's main agenda is to spend the first 10 minutes reading/browsing key reference pages on the Curiosity rover for 10 minutes, then an open-ended discussion:
                - Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)
                - Nasa mission page: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html
                - Video found by Victor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaUhLXolGaI
            - I've created a section for Curiosity in the References page with these links. Please dump anything else interesting you find there. Feel free to create other reference sections. We'll organize better once we have more.
            - We will also spend some time discussing how to use Twitter to do light-weight self-documentation of the project.
            - Initial reactions
                - [[Grigori Milov]]
                    - rover material, weather on moon and mars
                    - curiosity ~1 ton, fresh eyes on mechanism
                    - Eric - curiosity has plutonium
                    - Venkat's view powering by nuclear needed when power budget is more
                    - Anuraj's reaction launch considerations on nuclear powered rover
                    - basic rover design has been changing
                - [[Anuraj R]]
                    - sojourner and missions, rocker bogie, low budget
                    - Anuraj's reaction launch considerations on nuclear powered rover
                    - Mission cost for the high because of margin of error
                - [[Victor Hill]]
                    - Communications with satellites more realiable, communications with has a lot of lag
                    - problems with CPU and resets, redundancy, raspberry is way more powerful
                    - RTG is also warming up the systems, pretty hard to keep things warm without RTG and just with solar
                    - Venkat - Reasons mammals evolve to operate at wider range of temperatures
                    - Probe on curiosity didn't dig deep enough for experiments
                    - Venkat  - Mars to Earth communication power budget is huge. If there is Star Link on Mars then power budget is less
                    - Separate rover from payload. Payload can be land every couple of years. Spreads out risk of mission over time. 
                    - Sample return on Perseverance
                - [[Eric Platon]]
                    - Communication also has big power budget
                    - A YakSat? for communication?
                    - Eric - curiosity has plutonium
                    - Rover is actually a platform. Perseverance looks similar and blue print is same as Curiosity
                    - Programming language called PLEXIL - from around 2006, first deployed in Curiosity
                    - The framing of mission is pretty narrow, that's why it is important to make a platform
                - [[Maier Fenster]]
                    - There is much less water around Curiosity
                    - Tool for measuring soil temperature and it broke. 
                    - Generality of tool is limited, not designed as a general purpose rover, analogy is astronaut with gloves, the minute we put on gloves things become difficult
                    - Are we making a general purpose rover ? How do we choose the hardware on it? 
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                    - Press Releases - 9 out of 10 were mission, occasional operation things, like something is broken
                    - First principles for rover 
                        - cost things are way lower 
                        - many different rovers -> distributed systems
                    - Sojourner never went too far away from the base station
                    - One way to approach - what can be done with commodotized hardware?
                    - Instead of single platform, configurable rover, unbundle mobility component
                    - Software is kind of interesting, Is there is single rover operating system? General enough for various environments
                    - What is pie chart of mission cost? 
                    - Scavenging when rover breaks down when economies of scale kicks in. Dump 100 rovers changes the equation
                    - If there are frequent launches then various combination of rovers are possible
                    - Elon's tweet on how to make fuel on Mars.

        - Notes
            - Jascha -- use an oscilloscope to test how much sag there is across gpio power when all motors are powered
            - Use higher amperage to power it all, 36W not enough
            - Ground loops
            - No back drive protection on the RPi 5v GPIO, so that may be why it didn't like the USB + direct power

            - CPU and GPU different tradeoff. CPU is general and less efficient than GPU in matrix operations

                - [OAK 1](https://store.opencv.ai/products/oak-1) -- OAK-D depth variant requires 12v - 
                - Luxonis is the company that makes the hardware chip in OAK-1 https://luxonis.com/depthai#backstory
            - Venkat - 
                - Input Data Rate and Output summary going to Rpi two parameters and ratio of them gives info about efficiency of the OAK-1? 
                - If we all standardize on OAK-1 then we could have common abstraction? 
                - Can a full SLAM be done on OAK-1? Can the camera tell send a graph after doing some A* sort of path-planning and just that info to RPi
                - What if we wanted to add two or more cameras? How to distributed vision with OAK-1
                    - Eric - Maybe not use OAK-1 and use OAK-D?
                - In a democracy of humans - humans just share semantic information and not raw data why they vote in specific directions. Cameras could do something similar and share the semantic labels they see and a fusion could be done a higher abstract level like a mind-meld of the semantic information. Maybe this could be possible in the next years
            - Eric - 
                - OAK-1 to RPi communication can just a binary of 1 or 0 showing presence or absense of object.
                - OAK-1 compute can do JPEG compression can stream it via communication channel
                - What is the power draw? OAK-D not economical power wise
                - Maybe in cars, maybe a dedicated processing unit that is connected to all cameras of cars 
                - OAK-D has two cameras and single compute unit. It is not the mind-meld of semantic information
            - Maier - 
                - SLAM Hardware - https://blog.slamcore.com/the-slam-hardware-conundrum
                - Do we really need to detect objects for navigation or just extract rover salient information from image
                - Can you send the semantic model of the world be sent from one OAK to another OAK? 
                    - Eric - That could be done through the RPi, but that is costly operation because a lot of data has to be moved
            - Jascha -
                - On processor 
                    - On cars compute does not happen on the camera and all data comes to redundant central compute units. All safety critical things are fed into the pipeline
                    - On safety critical systems all the inference has to be fed into redundant compute units and then vote
                    - Nvidia Jetson is modular and it is possible to have 12 cameras feeding into a compute units
            - Rhett
                - What if the two units disagree?
                    - Jascha - Maybe have health checks of each unit, rerun the inference. The failure mode is catastrophic and if there is disagreement then there is something serious is up
                    - Venkat - The Air France crash was an example of this. The tie break is done pilot

                    - Maier - i would leave the stars as is when trying to climb.
                    - Venkat - A rocker bogie can climb 2x steps relative to wheel height, so a 6" wheel can climb a 12" step theoretically

        - Review of what it is to program an MCU to control peripherals. Overview of C, Assembly and memory addressing.
        - Review of typical software architecture:
            - Legacy super-loop architecture.
            - Multiple super-loops with RTOS, with notes on what "real-time" means in embedded development, including challenges. Baseline: Most people start with super-loop and move to RTOS only when really necessary.
        - Basic problems with Arduino: Less efficient per dollar.
            - Standard lib is doing more than necessary, to be user friendly.
            - Memory consumption and speed.
            - Comfort for developers costs in flash memory to host and run all these extras we do not need anymore on a final product.
            - Some people share optimized versions of Arduino's APIs.
            - People usually move to platforms with automated optimization?

                - Discord - chat interface usable by human and computer alike
                    - New program can be uploaded to the rover via Discord
                    - Python program on rover listens to Discord server
                    - Bots get an user ID like a human user
                - Twilio
                    - support of all sorts of connectivity
                    - Eric - was video in the browser with Twilio? 
                        - Maier - Yes, currentlty this is using 10% of the CPU, Twilio uses  webRTC, it allows setting up web conferecing, interesting to set up well known tools to tap into the video stream. 
                            - Tricky part was setting up the headless chrome
                    - Venkat - What is headless chrome
                        - Maier - no browser GUI, headless chrome is an expensive way to connect to Twilio video conferencing 
                        - Venkat - How else could this be done? 
                            - Maier - One of the imp things with Twilio is that it gives a direct socket connection between browser and webcam etc
                            - In peer to peer connection there is a direct socket connection to the webcam on rover
                            - In the server mode, stream is sent to the server which serves the clients. If zoom had the tool-set it could be used to do the same kind of streaming
                - Twitter
                    - It is even more abstract than Discord interface
                    - Current bot says I am online with date for different text because two consecutive texts not allowed
                    - Venkat - Can multiple rovers use the same Twitter handle
                        - Maier - yes. 
                - Google Drive
                    - For offloading the generated data to cloud
                    - For shared access to database
                - Conceptual architecture and abstraction - a lot of work in progress
                    - levels of automation 
                        - highest level is machine does what ever it wants and tells you what it's doing while it is doing it
                - Next steps
                    - porting to other rovers? 
                    - provide 3rd party services
                    - AI modularity
                    - Venkat: Suggestion is to use Twitter for sharing/colloboration between rovers
                        - Maier: What is the format to send via Twitter? But lots of limitation with Twitter
                    - Anuraj: Does each rover need a new handle? 
                        - Venkat: One handle has advantages. Each type of rovers could have a hashtag like legged, wheeled etc. Interesting experiments can be run under a unified twitter handle

            - Where is the Ruby on Rails for Rovers? 
                - Community for software stack ? 
                - Victor - Why run ROS? one argument, compared to other things it is more tedious but it brings standardization. Not enough 
                    - Venkat - Who are the corporate sponsors?
                        - Victor - Amazon, Google, other small robotics specialized companies
                            - Amazon uses ROS2 for their Robotics as a Service. AWS RoboMaker
                    - Venkat - It is very horizontal and robot agnostic. Can it be more elegant by being specialized with Rovers? Eg upto 6 wheeled robots and 6 legged robots. Part of too many abstractions is to lose sight of underlying hardware.
                    - Victor - for flying robots the the stack is different
                    - Maier - ROS cannot be expeced to be OS

                            - What does Ruby on Rails for Rover look like? 
                            - What does an OS for Rover look like? 
                        - Maier - 
                            - Linux is not real time but works with real time components
                            - Jascha - Classic approach to this is buffers
                                - Maier - That is a good solution for Desktop but is it good for Rovers? 
                                - QNX is real time and VxWorks
                        - Victor - Does rover need to deterministically real time? 
                            - Jascha - Some big systems don't
                                - Byzantines general's problem - Send messages multiple time 
                                - Commutating a motor has be deterministic. Opensource o-drive has jitter but it is okay
                        - Venkat - Lower and Upper bound for determinism
                            - Eg - Interrupt gear, pilots shoot through the propellors
                            - Eg - synchronizing motor movement to camera exposure. Basic question does rover need synchronizing
                            - Jascha - Determinism has specific meaning, guaranteed timing
                                - For low inductance motor causes low time constants and jitter
                    - Maier - 
                        - We need to have some sort of subsumption architecture. Multiple levels of watch dogs. Asteroid detector
                        - What do we expect in useful ROS software OS? What else? If the rover is on Mars and controlled from Earth? 
                            - Humans are kind of real time systems but human culture is not real time? 
                            - Rhett - What is the scope of the term "OS"
                            - Jascha - RT vs Not. At the group of robot level, RT goes away. Determinism is at the lower level.

                    - Jascha - ROS1 vs ROS2
                        - ROS1 - Low volume high mix
                        - ROS2 - High volume, low mix
                        - Kiva Systems probably may not use ROS2, they may have own stack
                    - Rhett - Where does simulation fit in?
                        - Jascha - Selling automation is hard, so simulation lubricates the process and deep learning
                        - Venkat - When you are automating a large factory then simulation helps 
                        - Eric - Simulator can be used just for debugging the software stack
            - A good to question to ask to understand the architecture of software is "Who Hurt You?

                - Venkat - temporal interval calculus is especially useful for thinking of real-time system in terms of upper+lower bounds on events (think "generalized launch windows") I've always thought it could be the foundation of a proper robotic OS

            - New cycle program: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/zbS4aNTCP
            - September 20: Big meeting on organization, more impact, preps for 2022.
            - Targeting Fall event around November 2021.
        - Review intermediate build "Accessory before the fact"
            - Focus on electronics and programming
            - Much fewer parts than main build (see slide 10), still printing of 7 simple parts.
            - Beaglebone Blue package
                - Many I/O, notably to control DC motors.
                - Library install on MacOS a pain with Catalina. Needed to get High Sierra.
                - Programming was possible. It required using Cloud9 through AWS.
        - Review main build "Nature is murder"
            - Slide from 22
            - Move to OnShape
                - Parts in CAD made for PLA and aluminum
                - Aim at internal wiring (wires going in aluminum legs, and specific PLA design to accommodate)
                - Balljoint challenge in CAD: Limitation in OnShap, could not constrain sphere-in-sphere interactions.
                - No dynamic evaluation of the design in OnShape.
                    - Jascha mentions Autodesk Fusion can import and do that, or Ansys.
                    - Not many alternatives today, mostly exist for decades (Ansys), or "new age" like Autodesk.
                - The main build is aimed at being modular (scavengeability)
                    - Lead to flexible parts
                    - Jascha asks why not external wire. Venkat answers he may have to, see below.
            - Wiring challenges
                - Review of options on how to wire internally. Hard, naive approaches do not work.
                - Of course, Venkat starts with "ribbons" in parts. It does not work in practice.
                - Looking into different cabling and connectors. No decision yet.
                - External wiring looks the most promising option.
                - Many projects get delayed due to wiring specs.
                - Idea to make an R&D project here, if someone can be attracted.
            - TPU tyre printing
                - Side project, achieved within a few iterations.
                - TPU is not PLA. Need to go slow: 18 mm/s, about 1/3 the speed of PLA.
                - Open ideas to use TPU for bumpers, etc. Advice: Try TPU.
        - Discussion around the Fall event.
            - Venkat suggests we all propose a few R&D ideas relevant for the project.

                        - If problem is detected then human intervention
                        - Curiosity is semi-autonomous
                        - What is required for full autonomous?

                - [[Rhett Garber]] - What BOS looks like? 
                    - [[Eric Platon]] - Not much yet, currently the yellow and green box
                - [[Maier Fenster]] - BOS Advisor not SpiderBot? 
                    - [[Eric Platon]] - This is abstract guide,  - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FSgw1zMQVC4.png?alt=media&token=b39ed56f-009e-4317-ae01-d7c30d59c568)
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - What going forward means? Anthropologically there are references. Body orientation. Some tribes are north/south etc. Some tribes direction references to river direction. When the [[YR: Nature is Murder]] was being designed there was confusion during CAD design. The right hand view is left hand view in body centric view in OnShape. Probably what is needed find the symmetries. 
                - [[Anuraj R]] - Are the BOS Advisors human or software? 
                    - [[Eric Platon]] - Software processes are running all the time which react to events. Some situation in which the body might need to be always flat. Then this is not System1 and System2 which are more about commands. Any command can be overridden by the advisor
            - Artificial Abductive Reasoning On Mars
                - We want to say to the rover "Go to the destination, get some samples and come back"
                - Currently no use of Abductive Reasoning
                - The Martian by Ridley Scott
                    - Everyone thinks Mark is dead
                        - not here, lost contact in dust strom, witness being hit, humans are not well cut for Mars -> Enough evidence to conclude Mark is dead
                        - On different SOLs the satellite images of the site chanes -> Mar is alive. 
                        - The power of evidence
                            - Depending on what evidence we have we make different conclusions
                - Abductive Reasoning 101
                    - We as humans have ability to select evidence to make reasonings
                    - This has been formalized in the 19th century
                    - No guarantee the explanation is correct
                    - It allows to reason with uncertainty
                    - Formally abduction literally means collecting evidence in the 19th century
                - Sherlock Holmes main reasoning method is abductive reasoning. 
                    - Arthur Conan Doyle was born at the same time as this reasoning method was formalized
                - Autonomy Today on Mars rovers
                    - Currently "semi-autonomy"
                        - human planning (NAV team does this). Autonomous execution. Stop and ask for help if there is an anomaly(NASA term - hazard identification)
                    - On Perseverance
                        - AutoNav -
                            -  The engineers put on VR goggles and then use it for planning. Thinking while drive. Curiosity was 20m/h vs 120m/h for Perseverance
                        - ENav - Part of AutoNav
                    - Current limitations
                        - Self limitation - we want to limit autonomy because of safety of rover due to hazards

                    - Solution  level 1 - Inductive Reasoning
                        - Use observations to state a rule
                        - Problem - How to make the observations in the first place?

                    - [[Anuraj R]] - On rovers is the Induction and Abduction 
                        - [[Eric Platon]] - Deep learning is kind of inductive reasoning specifically supervised learning
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - Internal representation inside DL models that are recognizable for humans. The quote mentioned of Douglas Adams, Derg Gentley. Detectives think terms stable ontologies. Fascinating to engineer into a rover. Allow rover come up with it's own concepts then it is a true rover. Maybe right ontology is not easy to find by humans
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] - "open ended ontology creation for rovers"
                - [[Eric Platon]] - What it means to go forward for a rover depending on its body ?
                    - in terms of concepts inside rover it should be able to build it on its own
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] - Maybe the rover does not have that concept of forward? Then how to communicate with rover when there is no concept of rover 
                - [[Anuraj R]] - which robots was abductive reasoning used in? 
                    - [[Eric Platon]] - it was pretty hard see the value of abductive in early days. Most programming is inductive. deep learning is more of deductive. Abductive is still out of reach

                - Old school way was to implement the whole OS in the container
                - In windows and mac it is lightweight VM
                - Tries to solve problem "It works for me on my local computer"
                - Helps in producing research more reproducible. Provide code + docker file + data to reproduce the research env. It makes the assumptions and requirements transparent
                - Docker is fairly hard to keep in a HPC cluster
            - Why Docker exists? 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FaBfO4s0w3k.png?alt=media&token=06494a06-a4bd-4c51-b079-984881b3ad5a)
                - Code would work development env but not in prod. 
                - Regular Linux runs around 200 processes. Docker container run application + minimal processes
                - It makes automating the whole pipeline, from building to deplying

        - Discussion
            - [[Anuraj R]] - What happens when two containers try to access the same hardware in the RPi? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - would not work, same as when two processes try to access same hardware
            - [[Maier Fenster]] - What about caching when git pull in caching? 
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - Why use docker and not run native directly? Maybe for code sharing? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - value starts when you want to come back to something that works. On Raspbian the ROS had to compiled from scratch. Docker is a good way to avoid this building from scratch
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - In space how would this work ? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - Is this new? No. The fundamental issue is the question "will my code run" ?
            - [[Rhett Garber]] - For bare metal Arduino, one needs USB. For RPi ssh and VSCode runs fine. Not sure about complicated use-cases? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - Is it Raspbian or Ubuntu? 
            - [[Anuraj R]] - Has the PiCar been teleoperated? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - very basic operation was tried out earlier

                    - no fiducials were used, nasa uses a lot fiducials markers on rovers
                    - simulator performance degrades when multiple rovers are added
        - Discussion
            - [[Victor Hill]] - Total resource requirement to run a simulation? What was interesting in the simulation? 
                - Fabian - physics engine simulation problems
            - [[Anuraj R]] - How many teams participated ? 
                - Fabian - around 100 in the beginning and 14 in the last round
            - [[Maier Fenster]] - Why was monitoring very difficult? 
                - Fabian - one of the aspects of rovers working together is some were manual and some were autonomous. then when the rovers start working together then there are a lot of thiings to observe multiple things. Lots of context to know the state of the rovers
                - [[Maier Fenster]] - is that the problem is of the simulator or architecture of the mission of rovers? will the problems be seen in real rovers? 
                - Fabian - maybe the real rovers would also have similar problems 
            - [[Maier Fenster]] - how detailed the simulation need to be for a simple mission
                - Fabian - is the tooling for the operator enough or not? The big vision was to see how people will make strategies to operate the rovers, how many rovers to send etc? 
            - [[Anuraj R]]- Did everyone in the project use Gazebo? 
                - Fabian - Yes
            - [[Maier Fenster]] - was using ROS suitable? 
                - Fabian - Yes. For ROS it was easy to find libraries for indoor robots. For outdoor field robots the libraries needed tweaking
            - [[Eric Platon]] - Everything inthe project was ROS1? 
                - Fabian - yes
            - [[Anuraj R]] - Was the competition time based? 
                - Fabian - simulation was 2 hours, the simulation was run NASA machines
            - [[Anuraj R]] - Was the communcation delay also simulated? 
                - Fabian - yes
            - [[Jascha Wilcox]] - evaluating the simulation performance was manual? was there any automated tests to test the performance? 
                - Fabian - regression tests for computer visions. would have been better to run tests for subsystems in isolation 
                - [[Eric Platon]] - is there any tool or framework that allows this automated testing? 
                - Fabian - 
                    - applied intuition company - https://www.appliedintuition.com
                    - https://robotika.cz/en
            - [[Eric Platon]] - could simulation become a useful tool? 
                - Fabian - the cost of space is really high, for testing it could be useful

                - [[Maier Fenster]] - Trying out to figure the communication protocol between rovers with [[Victor Hill]]. Maybe some HTTP based protocol? 
                - [[Victor Hill]] - We want to send command, information and data 
                - [[Maier Fenster]] - just sending information is not super interesting. Maybe Rhett has Neural Network hardware, then a request could be send to Ml operations. 
                    - usecase - one rover 
                - [[Sai Prasanna]] - the commands are at an abstract level which is quite high right? 
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] - same command can or cannot be execute on the different kinds of rovers. right now we want the rovers to be able to talk with each other and share processing capabilities. after that we want rovers to be able
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - how does this connect to affordances and abductive reasoning. the HTTP based protocol seems that a declarative commands behind the scenes. 
                    - [[Eric Platon]] - this line though goes further 
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - abductive synthesis?

                - VGR: What we want is declarative language that does abductive reasoning.
                    - "It starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations"
                        - Maybe we want abductive synthesis.
