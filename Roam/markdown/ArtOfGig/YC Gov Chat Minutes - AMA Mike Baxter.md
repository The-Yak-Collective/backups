- Transcript:
    - d k:  Hey Mike, Mike Baxter GMT plus one. I have looked up your Discord profile actually. So I'll just give a quick read through.
        - Mike is from London and he's been an independent consultant for 20 years. His firm is called Goal Atlas. He's worked in strategy, digital transformation, sales and marketing, across a number of industries such as retail, tech travel, pharma, financial services, and more, has also been involved in some of London's tech startups. And so we have Mike here today to talk about his indie career, his new book The Strategy Manual, and to field any questions about those two things, as well as I guess the topic of this call typically is around online governance and maybe to shed some insight into where, where he thinks that collective could go next, where it's interesting and more.
        - So, Mike, I'll let you introduce yourself briefly, as well.
    - Mike Baxter: 
        - I've been independent for twenty years, although for quite a bit of my indie career I got a lot of work through an organisation called Econsultancy (econsultancy.com). They offer a subscription service for digital marketers, giving them access to technical reports and to big trade events. I started off being an author of several of their reports and speaker at many of their events (I trained as a psychologist and had worked as a research scientist for many years, so I applied these skills to a very quantitative analysis of e-commerce sites - this was in 2004). Then, because of their position as a trusted authority on digital marketing, Econsultancy's subscribers, most of whom worked in big enterprises, started asking for help. 'Do you know anyone who could help with marketing analytics?' 'Who could work with us to re-platform our website?' 'Can you help us make sense of Digital Transformation for our organisation?' Fortunately, for me they didn't have any consultants on their staff so they asked their authors and speakers to consult on their behalf. Econsultancy managed the procurement, set the price (in the early days in discussion with the consultant), managed delivery and then procured consultants to do the work.  This paid me around half of my total consultancy income for almost 10 years.
        - So I think it's quite interesting as a case study from the Yak Collective point of view - how could we become the trusted (and widely recognised) authority that started to be asked for help by big enterprise clients? 
        - Of course, I got quite a lot of big clients completely independently. They heard me speak, they read my reports and approached me directly. I was approached directly by Google, for example, and worked with them over an 18 mont period. I was also approached by several tech start-ups in London to ask if I could advise them. Mostly I was helping them with their product road-maps - in one case I was their part-time Chief Product Officer, as they went through their initial growth. I'm now in my third main start-up gig. The first one went wrong, the second one sold to a well-established enterprise and the third is progressing through the classic fast-growth trajectory and successive VC funding rounds.
        - Most recently, my indie career has taken a different turn. I've become much more focused on productizing my knowledge and experience and building a 'price escalator' to sell them: give something away for free, to get prospects interested in buying something for a few 10s of £/$. This then gets them interested in the product I sell for a few 100s of £/$, which leads to the products I sell for a few 1,000s of £/$. This is what led me to write my book, to build a suite of online workshops and to produce my own software platform.
    - d k  
        - Yeah, that sounds good to me. And if people have questions, I guess drop them in voice meta.
        - Cool. So yeah. Thanks. Thanks for telling us a little bit about your indie career. Have there been other kind of major arcs in that career? It sounds like there was first the intro from Econsultancy, then transitioning more fully independently. And that was still have hourly gigs. And then kind of the third arc is around, you're publishing this book, you have these products and services. Is that a good encapsulation?
    - Mike Baxter: 
        - Yes, getting started is hard work. It is particularly difficult for an indie consultant to get through the procurement process of big multinational clients. This is something Yak Collective could definitely help with, especially if we have anyone in the community with experience of running a procurement office in a big multi-national corporation.  When I have managed, completely independently, to land a big multi-national corporation as a client, it is because they thought I had a unique combination of skills and experience they couldn't find in the bigger consultancies.
    - d k  
        - Gotcha, that makes sense. And, yeah, tell us a little bit about I guess, these distinctive skills, like what is your consulting practice look like? What are the kind of tools of the trade? What are your inspirations?
    - Mike Baxter: 
        - I began working in ecommerce and in digital marketing.  I did a lot of deep-dive work in statistics for my PhD, so was comfortable working with data, which definitely gave me an edge.  I moved quite quickly into tech and platform work. If, as a psychologist, I had produced a user-needs analysis for a tech platform, I then needed to be able to understand which tech platforms best suited my defined user needs.  I then broadened from digital marketing into marketing and sales. I did a big job for Cisco integrating their marketing and sales teams into a single team.  This then led me into 'Digital Transformation' just as it was becoming a buzz word. This is also potentially big learning for Yak Collective. Identify a rising trend and harness our collective effort to become established as a trusted authority on that topic. We did this very successfully within Econsultancy. Several of us wrote reports on digital transformation and related topics. The Econsultancy team did a great job with SEO, so lots of consultancy requests started to come in. And the more work we did in this area, the more expertise we gained and the greater our lead over competitors became.  In one pitch, the client really wanted to work with one of the big-name consultancies but found that my experience as an individual consultant was greater than the combined experience of all the consultants in their preferred big-name companies (I'd just finished three digital transformation projects with three different clients in the pharma sector).
        - Right now, I am focused on strategy and excited by the prospects it offers me. I'm on a crusade to persuade organisations that strategy is for everyone, from the Board all the way to front-line teams.  
        - So, the question for Yak Collective is how can we identify topics that are new and of growing interest to our prospective clients and then how can we consolidate our expertise and establish 'trusted authority' status  on that topics? And do all that before the topics gets too crowded and too competitive?
    - d k  
        - Cool, that makes sense. I think there's one question from john. Mike, do you think COVID will have a lasting impact on indie consultancy, ie remote first, for example, working for clients in any location, parallel projects, global collaboration, Bitcoin, etc?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - Definitely! Probably in two key ways. Firstly there are lots of tactical changes, like remote working and clients being comfortable to work with a consultant they never meet face-to-face. Secondly, and more strategically, though, it has shifted how organisations see risks. We should have seen the cover pandemic coming. In fact, we did actually see it coming. In 2017 the WHO estimated the risk of a major outbreak of a new virus at 3% per year and the risk of a new viral pandemic at 1% per year. Organisations just didn't plan proportionately to the risk and its impact. So, I believe organisations will start to adopt a much more structured and systematic approach to risk assessment and mitigation. And this is going to be quite a big opportunity for consultants to get into. It is also going to require a blend of wide-ranging expertise, so possibly another one for Yak Collective to look at.
    - d k  
        - Nice. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. And that's also kind of where my head is at been lately.
        - Awesome. Well, if there's no other questions on that, specifically, maybe we can start talking a little bit about your new book, The Strategy Manual.
        - And I guess I'll start off with these two bullets that I extracted from a note that you sent me. So strategy is about the transformational change of anything. I believe strategy is one of those foundational disciplines. Those two sentences stuck out to me.
        - One, I guess, tell me like, Why Why did you write this book? And how does it how do you feel like it was distinguished from the other shadier frameworks that are out there that perhaps, you felt like might be a little bit lacking or not reflective of your process?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - So, and this is gonna sound a bit sort of critical, but for the sake of time, I'm not going to try and make it subtle. If you look at a lot of the strategy books out there, they provide 'perspectives' on strategy, so Michael Porter, for example, says strategy is all about competitors and gaining competitive advantage.  Gary Hamel, on the other hand, says strategy is all about building internal capabilities. Both of these are both useful insights (and, of course, both are right) but they don't tell me how to 'do' strategy. Once I've finished writing my strategy, what do I do next?  How do I stop it being left in everyone's desk drawer and forgotten?  How do I make my strategy adaptable? Or agile? How do I check if it is innovative enough?  So, most strategy books tell you how to think about strategy. I wanted to write one that tells you how to do strategy. Hence the Strategy Manual. Like a workshop repair manual for a car. Practical. Hands-on. Detailed. 
        - I also think strategy is foundational. So there's this notion of the natural sciences and the artificial sciences. Nobel prize winner, Herbert Simon come up with this in the 1960s. The artificial sciences including economics, engineering, design and politics etc. Now the fundamentals of the natural sciences, are well understood - physics or chemistry. But what are the fundamentals of the artificial sciences?  I believe that strategy is one of them and that strategy is about the deliberate transformational change of anything.
        - So, my aim was to write a practical manual but with practices that were derived from first principles.
    - d k  
        - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
        - There are some other kind of waves of strategy, like I see, for example, Simon Wardley tossed around a bit, I've done some of his mapping before, how does
        - how do you think about the modern landscape of strategy and how people are applying it, you know, what are what are like the McKinsey's of the world? What are the Capgemini is doing? Are they actually working on strategy or..?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - So, there's lots of interesting discussions about how strategy's changing. And we've had a bit of a discussion in Discord about reports (e.g. CB Insights report) that we are approaching the end of strategy. In some ways, I agree. The approach of the big-three consultancies (McKinsey, Bain and BCG) is to take the task of strategy out of their client companies, resolve it and drop it back in as a completed piece of work.  This doesn't often transformationally change anything!.  I'm much ore convinced by the idea that strategy needs to become an in-house capability, we can't just outsource it and get somebody else to do it, and then parachute it back into the organization. That just doesn't work. We've got to develop that discipline expertise in house, because strategy doesn't just live with the senior leadership team.  Strategy is for everyone. From the Board all the way to the front-line teams.
        - Strategy, therefore, is a period of transition.  The old out-sourced model of strategy is coming to an end yet many organisations still don't know how to do strategy well themselves.  There are, therefore, lots of opportunities.  And again, maybe, opportunities for the Yak Collective. How can we enable our prospects and clients to do strategy better themselves. This is not re-packaging McKinsey, Bain or BCG, it's fundamentally different. It is more collaborative, it is more participative. it brings the organisation along on the strategy journey. As a result there is more shared ownership of the strategy and hence more likelihood of transformational change being achieved. This is the stuff that we do. And of course, my argument, because I've just written the workshop manual on it is that we should be focusing on the principles that constitute a process of managing strategy. And that's not just rolling it out across the organization as well.
    - d k  
        - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think a lot of lot of the collective members come from more of a digital or like tech industry background. And then just like personally seeing how, like McKinsey, Bain BCG, are all trying to open like their digital arms and seeing them try to adapt to that change. So I think that's very telling. Because you address the the, like wardley map for a bit, I've talked like it's been a topic, occasionally on the collective. There are a few practitioners, but mostly people don't seem to know how to place it in as a tool in their practice.
    - Mike Baxter  
        - I happen to be a big fan of strategy mapping, but we need to be very clear about what we mean by strategy mapping.  Wardley mapping is similar in certain to respects to the strategy mapping that Kaplan and Norton proposed for their Balanced Scorecard, in the 1990s. Balanced Scorecard mapping plots strategic goals across four 'perspectives' - financial, customer, internal and learning-and-growth. The idea here is that strategy for a commercial organisation is ultimately for financial gain. To achieve this financial gain you need to change how you deal with customers. To do this you need to change internal processes and to change internal processes you need to learn and grow as an organisation. This, as a key design feature of the strategy map, suggests you cannot change internal processes to bring about financial gain without going through customers. This is clearly wrong (e.g. improving supply chain management) and is a limitation of this type of strategy mapping. Wardley mapping is also constrained. It explores the value chain delivered by an organisation (from customer need to value proposition) and maps this according to how evolved the organisation's offering is (genesis, custom-offering, product or commodity). Both balanced scorecard mapping and Wardley maps are both a particular type of map, called a topological map. A well understood example of a topological map is the London Underground map, where all stations are show in a grid with connections between them at 90 or 45 degree angles. This is great for travelling by underground but useless for navigating London streets by foot. A topological map is, therefore a map that has been simplified and distorted to serve a particular purpose. As a result it can be constraining or misleading for other purposes.  My frustration with these topological maps led me to develop what I think is less constraining and more representative form of mapping for strategy. It is based on the why:how logic devised for value engineering by Larry Miles in 1947 and elaborated by Charles Bytheway in 2007. To learn more about it I produced a 3 minute summary of it at https://vimeo.com/336306881. 
    - d k  
        - Do you want to also comment on soft skills and their importance and any just regular thoughts?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - One of the key differentiators between those of us who have been consulting for several years and somebody who has just started is their use of soft skills. To give you an example of this, I did a bunch of digital transformation projects in a row where I ended up working on something completely different from what the client originally asked me to do.  This required a bunch of soft skills to listen really intently to what the client was asking for and seek clarification, where appropriate. Then I might do a bit of analysis and come back with some questions. After a couple of rounds of this the client had persuaded themselves they'd had a better idea on what I should work on. They hadn't.  I'd nudged them towards that view. But if I'd started that engagement by telling them their brief for me was wrong and I had a better idea, they'd have probably found themselves a different consultant.  These are critical soft skills that I took a while to learn.  Another difference is that as you progress in your consultancy career, you build a bigger and more diverse toolbox of hard skills. In my early days, every problem was a nail and my hammer was the perfect tool to hit it with. Now I can offer half a dozen tools for most problems and see which is best suited to the context and culture of any particular client.  
    - d k  
        - Makes sense. Thanks, Mike. Grigori has a question how do you evaluate or access strategies or if you wish, processes of devising and implementing strategies?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - Okay, so it is really important to have a good toolkit for evaluating strategies. So I'll just mention a couple. So firstly, I have a House of Strategy model. This shows how vision, mission and strategy fit together and you can see it at https://goalatlas.com/house-of-strategy/. This model can be used either to audit an organisation or used creatively to generate a new vision, mission and strategy that align well.  I also have a Hallmarks of Good Strategy model that has just been released this week - https://goalatlas.com/hallmarks-of-good-strategy. In broader and more general terms, I also have a strategy lifecycle model, which suggests strategy passes through three distinct stages in its lifecycle - product (the strategy production process), adopt (the strategy adoption process) and adapt (the strategy adaptation process), which is also a useful way to assess or evaluate how strategy is working within an organisation.
    - d k  
        - Thanks for the brief overview. I know one thing that you mentioned to me was that there were these diagrams, sounds like the House of Strategy might be one of them that you're releasing to the Creative Commons, do you want to touch on that a bit more?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - As far as I'm concerned, all these strategy models and frameworks are only valuable if they are actually used. So, I decided quite early on if I'm going to go to the trouble of writing this book, I want to make sure that the main models and frameworks are not locked into a copyright that a publisher doesn't want to release. As a result, of course, I couldn't find a publisher prepared to publish this book, if I was just going to release all its valuable content freely to the world.  I, therefore, ended up having to publish it myself and am in the process of releasing the models and frameworks on Creative Commons - sign-up for notifications of their release at https://goalatlas.com/models/. Each one we release has an explanation of the model and how to use it. It has images of the model you can download and use in your own presentations or strategy documents. And it has templates for using the model, in some cases with a worked example of the template, having been completed.
    - d k  
        - awesome, I think, yeah, I think a lot of people will be interested in that. Maybe, you know, we're at 30 minutes. And I'm sure some people are have to drop off.
        - And feel free to do so if you do, but maybe we can go on for another 10-15 minutes. That works.
        - Cool. Okay. So I figured we could, there's more to talk about about consulting, obviously. But I figured we could pivot into the online governance portion where, you know, tell us what you think about the app collective what what are your interests? Tell us about how you think some of these new organizations should be thinking about strategy and organization in the future, and how that impacts the collective.
    - Mike Baxter  
        - So today, we are in an emergent phase - lots of people are exploring their interests, their expertise, their passions - lots of getting to know each other. And that's great. Really healthy. But what happens when a real opportunity comes along. Something a bunch of us would love to get involved in. Something that could pay us a decent fee for our work together. Something that could make a difference and leave a mark. We need to be able to change gear and work in a very different way. We need to be able to pull together a meaningful identity and strategic positioning. We need to find ways to get our voice heard. We need to have coherent and distinctive propositions. We need to be able to receive and respond to inbound enquiries from our prospective clients. Then, of course we need to land the contract, deliver the results and pay our contributors. All this isn't going to happen on its own, so a key challenge for governance right now is how we maintain this emergent way of working whilst building community-based professional capabilities?
    - d k  
        - Yeah, I think so. I think that that that makes a lot of sense.
        - Why, yeah, maybe go into online governance is a bit more like Are there any particular organizations that you think are also emergent and chaotic and interesting.
    - Mike Baxter  
        - This is something I've struggled with. I'm not sure I've seen any that work spectacularly well. I'm not despondent about it, because I have faith we could probably work it out. There seem to be a bunch of really bright people who are really enthusiastic about Yak Collective as a general experiment. One concern I have is that I personally haven't yet found a core challenge or opportunity that I can join a group to take shared ownership of. Once a group of us find a tangible opportunity to chase after, I suspect we would have to make the online governance fit-for-purpose for that opportunity.
    - d k  
        - Yeah, that seems reasonable. There's, there's areas that it requires an opportunity. So maybe we can chat about that. Like Where do you think the next opportunities are coming.
    - Mike Baxter  
        - It's quite difficult for me to see past opportunities related to strategy. There's gonna be a whole bunch of organizations planning for the post-coved era and asking how they can build-back-better. And saying, let's not make the same mistakes as we did last time around. I've already talked about how they will be looking for ways to manage and mitigate risks better, but in a more positive note they are also going to be wanting to know how to be more strategic and to be strategic in a much more purposeful and impactful way. So, for example, I've been working on some models for looking strategically at purpose-beyond profit.
        - There are going to be some big opportunities coming in the next 12 months and lots of opportunities to break with old models of service delivery and consultancy. We are all just going to need to be really diligent in spotting (or creating) the next big issue (or hype cycle, if we are being cynical about it) and then really agile in designing our offering in response.
    - d k  
        - Awesome, great answer.
        - I'm trying to scroll back to see if there's any questions that we didn't address. Um,
        - there's one from Arman, how would you grow a company by 10 X in five years?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - Okay, my simple answer is that for my own business I wouldn't. I'd rather go for organic growth. I have, however, been involved in companies that have sustained hyper-growth over many years. In current software-as-a-service growth models, 10x growth in 5 years isn't fast enough - they are going for 3x, 3x, 2x, 2x and 2x growth in the years after they hit £1M revenue. That's fast! And do achieve this they need a really, really crisp strategy, an amazingly rigorous strategic plan that stretches a year or two into the future (because with such rapid growth, you need to sow the seeds now that you will be dependent upon in 18 months time)? I can't be much more specific about confidential stuff, but I'm certainly very happy to have a chat either offline, or in a different channel, if you want to continue this conversation.
    - d k  
        - cool. I'm sorry, I didn't catch what, uh, what's the name of the company are you like what, what is your capacity of working with them - as a as a consultant?
    - Mike Baxter  
        - The tech start-up company I'm working with right now is Ometria.com and I am an advisor to them
    - Transcribed by https://otter.ai and heavily edited by Mike Baxter - he tried to keep to the spirit of our conversation, even although he couldn't remember all the detail of what was actually discussed.
