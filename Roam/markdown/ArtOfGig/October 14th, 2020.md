                - Micro-workshops are free, virtual, interactive experiences, customized for your company. Different from webinars, these micro-workshops are hands-on and led by our best facilitators and topic experts. They are designed for small groups of around 10 people and are about 60-90 minutes long.
                - At the end of each micro-workshop, you’ll receive a customized output or report, capturing what you learned for future use.
                - You’ll collaborate in small groups. You’ll learn something new. You’ll get something done. You’ll move the needle. **Join us!**
