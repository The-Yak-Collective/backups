    - Agenda/Minutes

            - Main takeaways:
                - Internal Marketing is key to start with - we need to figure out who we are and what YC is for Yaks before we're able to revisit/scale our external marketing
                - YC should be defined by what we do and what we could do - what we do will define who we are (emergence). Defining who we are is premature-optimization. A bottom-up instead of a top-down approach.
                    - this seems more in-tuned with our decentralised, diverse DNA
                - YC can/should(?) be a place to do projects - have the freedom to leverage the Yaks and Collective to do projects.
                    - we can even have projects that are similar but different - because they have a different idea/purpose - e.g. we can have several Newsletters
                - The best way to communicate this "playground" idea is to give examples and testimonials
                -  Relaunch the [[Don’t Waste the Reboot]]?
                    - what would we add to that? a behind the scenes, making-of that tells about the potential?
                - Next Steps:
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} List all the projects in their different stage (idea/concept/wip/stalled/delivered)
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} survey Yaks to understand their motives/expectations/experience (TBD)
                        - from here we can do some 1-1 interviews
                    - Copy write some content on
                        - What we do is who we are
                        - YC as a "playground"/opportunities to build new projects
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] consider specifically issue of helping yaks market
                    - [[Maier Fenster]] @ajgram: is there any published material on the ideal customer profile for YC, and the type of projects it is best positioned to deliver superior results vs. traditional consulting firms?
        - {{[[DONE]]}} {{[[TODO]]}} List all the projects in their different stage (idea/concept/wip/stalled/delivered)
