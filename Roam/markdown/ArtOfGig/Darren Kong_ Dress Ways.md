- some of the speculations i’m thinking about wrt dress ways 
- coverage of offline/online representation
    - 
    -  we will represent ourselves on-line/off-line and in 20 years this will converge so dress ways needs to also consider both representations
- proof-of-work / proof-of-brain states —
    - was thinking about is how does `proof-of-work` become possible. encrypted attestations, etc.
    - proof-of-state / proof of-emotion / proof-of-experience 
        -  will also be used as “badges”. like meditation attainment. "oh you’ve been awakened have you”
    - neurodiversity will become more of a thing. seeking different states. 
        - no longer will it be, you look like a fun, attractive, young person to get into the club… it’ll be are you in the right brain state?
    - for a more real time, similar to some of the ideas wrt marriage/social. the idea of “wearing your heart on your sleeve”.
    - using physical devices may be a status symbol… imagine your Tesla is part of your fashion… just as it is today but in a more real way. or that you can control your environment as part of your brain state, you’re walking around with the idyllic world around you
- head jackers - some people will choose to walk around with VR/ Kernel all the time.
