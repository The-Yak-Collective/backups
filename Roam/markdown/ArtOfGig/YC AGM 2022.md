- Prompts from [[Venkatesh Rao]]:
    - What’s a creative format for an annual day in light of [[Venkatesh Rao]] state of play. I don’t think we should just repeat what we did last 2 years. It doesn’t really work. Maybe something like a lowkey yakathon or day-long coworking session focused on collaborative tinkering? In the past we;ve focused on PR/recruitment, but this time perhaps we should focus as
    - what orgs are we __most__ like, and __least__ like? Eg, YC is like libraries but unlike  startups. much or more on ourselves internally?
- [[Venkatesh Rao]] state of play
    - 1. Study groups and coworking sessions are clearly the core
    - 2. Prompt school is promising but needs some TLC
    - 3. I think we’ve unconsciously decided this is a small group (<50 practically) that grows 1 regular person at a time rather than big group, but we’re fine with lots of lurkers, rare drop-ins, etc. 
    - 4. “Onboarding” is the wrong frame but we haven’t found a better one
    - 5. “Capture and publish exhaust” is promising direction but still too hard
    - 6. I think working-in-public publishing (Twitter/YouTube) is easier than polished
    - 7. But when we do pull off polished things with nice webpage, it feels very satisfying
    - 8. Yak Rover is doing fine if viewed as a robotics study group, but struggling relative to original ambition
    - 9. The 2 study groups I think are hitting their intended ambition nicely
    - 10. Prompt school is __just__ short of a viable pattern, how to get it more robust?
    - 11. Crypto tech exploration earlier in the year was very fun but we didn’t have enough need to adopt
    - 12. Infrastructure?? Feels like stuff is happening there but not impacting YX (yak experience) or output yet
    - 13. Newsletter is basically not working in any meaningful way
    - 14. Several subcritical things: astonishing, yakfit, terraforming
    - 15. Slow and steady growth in people taking point on things long-term (this might be our KPI, I count maybe 7-8)
    - 16. A sort of slow-lane ethos taking shape. YC is where you go if you “quiet quit” hustle culture in a healthy way
    - 17. Coordination ceiling is very low — idea of a distributed systems map+lexicon didn’t gain traction
    - 18. I think og slide-deck project format is dead but still anchors our public posture like a bad hangover
    - 19. More promising formats — infinity pool, whitepaper/NFT not yet refined

    - 20. Bot infrastructure growing at the speed of Maier
    - 21. YouTube growing at the speed of Anuraj
    - 22. “Collaborative tinkering” seems like an accurate headline. I’d perhaps add “studying”? 
    - 23. Is this more like a “study room/study hall” for the cozyweb than “weird grad school”?
    - 24. We are depth-limited in studies and polish-limited in public output
    - 25. I’d like more momentum at current tempo over growth or acceleration/scaling… not sure what that means
