- [[Johnicholas Hines]]
    - had several convos with [[Thomas Verhagen]] and [[James Young]]
        - they were thinking Ethereum 
    - requirement for more illegibility
        - what if the bot doesn't enforce accounting
        - but what if it summarizes sociologically what have been doing
        - people can consult that summary to enforce various actual consequences
        - thumbs up a message doesn't necessarily correspond to votes or 
            - aggregating thumbs up though
        - wrote some code to interface w discord 
        - captures emoji reacts
            - likely possibilities
                - google sheets
                - airtable
                - plain-text accounting in git
            - more remote possibilities:
                - sqlite or google firestore db 
            - each of these technologies -> corporate relationship 
        - intentionally illegible system vs map to money 
        - plain text accounting tools https://plaintextaccounting.org/
            - hledger
        - ports and adapter
            - the existing bot is essentially between discord API -> center
        - google sheets
            - glide https://www.glideapps.com/
    - johnicholas - didn't get much feedback once moving away from ethereum/bitcoin 
    - Venkat - i like this whole direction
        - there's a lot of people that are into blockchain/DAO
            - we can insert that, but it's not primary intent to be an experiment for cryptocurrency community, so it's ok to lose that crowd 
        - until we play around with a bot, can't participate in the discussion
    - minting vs deducting from a balance
        - negative emoji balance. could have soft rules... emoji balances per channel 
    - interfaces
        - ledger
        - balance sheet
    - units / systems 
        - voting
        - auctions
        - currencies
        - retweets/likes/thumbs up/thumbs down
    - integrating into website - version 3 
        - there will be a backend 
            - next 2-3 months 
        - we could link to read-only view of google sheets
        - client side javascript pull
        - or build from git csv
    - different types of value
        - how do we reconcile clever comment vs contribution 
        - can only use one react per project 
            - 1, 2, 4, 8 multipliers
            - could also have a direct transaction bot for more than both 
    - two emojis?
        - thank you ? 
            - could be a "promise" to an outstanding task 
        - hands up ? 
    - MVP
        - 3 emojis, 3 denominations - 9 emojis
            - 1. infrastructure 
            - 2. project contributions
            - 3. social 
        - google sheets
