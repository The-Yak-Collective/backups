- Page for the #ai-workshop channel on Discord
- We read a paper/article or do a small learning task every week. New readings and prompts are posted on Tuesdays.
- April 12, Week 1: [ML Perf paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01500.pdf)
    - Venkat: ML Perf is more like SATs or GRE than like traditional hardware benchmarking, which is more like EEGs or fMRI
- April 19, Week 2: [Taxonomy of NNs](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464)
    - Prompt: What would good 2x2 axes for this taxonomy be?
- April 26, Week 3: Transformers, read at least one of the 3 things below
    - Good [less-technical explainer](https://thenextweb.com/news/understanding-transformers-the-machine-learning-model-behind-gpt-3-machine-learning-ai-syndication)
    - Good [more-technical explainer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
    - The original paper, [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) is really hard...
- May 3, Week 4
- Backlog/hopper
    - Hands on 1
        - Google Colab
    - Hands on 2
        - For technical people: Install PyTorch (Python/Anaconda first if necessary)
        - For non-technical people: Find and use an AI-based image-manipulation tool
    - Latent spaces https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0164-7
    - Software 2.0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y57wwucbXR8
