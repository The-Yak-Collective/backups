- for the march 9 [[Yak Rover]] meeting
- two questions:
    - what is a rover
    - what do we think is a rover and what we expect of it
- paper on rover limits and sizes, skip to page 33 if you want::
    - https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1706/1706.05356.pdf
- some dimensions of rovers::
    - life: 1 min .. 1khours
    - attention: continuous .. intermittent .. events
    - coverage ability: 0% .. 100%
    - mass delivered: 0 .. 1T
    - power local .. remote
    - brain local .. remote
    - speed mm/day .. km/hour
    - motor complexity: 0 .. 1 .. 20 
    - range 1m .. 1000km
    - location: below, on, above ground
    - payload: none/replacable/dedicated/general
    - ability to interact with world: "leave only footprints" .. "earth moving"
    - autonomy: "does what it is told" .. "specific goal" .. "self-goal"
    - ignoring social and ecosystem!
- some rover (?) examples - needs to be made into concrete examples::
    - for each one (as pulldown)::
        -  a rover
        - barely a rover
        -  not a rover
        - +what is its most missing feature
    - solar powered wheeled, with orbiter-transmitted RF or light
    - ball with no external payload or carrying ability
    - wind driven ball or balloon
    - wind driven with shelter-in-place ability
    - ball with one motor only
    - wheeled rover
    - power from sky, solar, nuclear, wind, from land (different sizes of power supply)
    - worm/rover/glider/balloon
    - a vortex with remote sensing and brain and maybe even power
    - field with transmitters of power
    - legged thing
    - 
- critical rover components (for sim)::
    - power
    - sensing
    - locomotion
    - payload
    - planning
    - communication
    - housekeeping
- task parameters::
    - rover
    - definition of task
    - time budget
