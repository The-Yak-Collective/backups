                - how do we use the #[[Future Frontiers]] to bring fun gigs
                    - 2 extremes
                        - Large corp that think big (Amazon, Tesla)
                        - Startups cash rich - 2nd act - no VC pressure - they can think big
                    - Who?
                        - +VP (signing ability critical)
                        - personally interested in this kind of gigs
                    - Channels
                        - 3rd party channels? probably not now.
                    - Does the content match the target?
                        - pointer/teaser - proof of capability 
                        - leads to a proposal
            - Should we market a #[[Pop-Up Think Tank]]?
            - other product (many 5-6 minimal size, but can also do two yaks)
                - in-depth parallel investigation like #[[Yaks do innovation consulting]]
                    - #[[Astonishing Stories]] can also fit here 
                - #[[Pop-Up Think Tank]]
                    - #[[Donâ€™t Waste the Reboot]]
                    - #Neurofuturama
                    - #[[The New Old Home]]
                    - diverse perspectives is a key benefit 
                - speculative design fiction (like mars rover)
                - actually managing something
                    - online-offsites
                - how-to manual 
                    - online-offsites
                    - slice-the-pie
                - analyst + insights report, more forward looking and less based on past data collection, yes based on secondary sources. note yaks act as bridges betweenbubbles 
                    - can be based on special knowledge of one yak
                    - can be based on a  group that together has the expertise
                - pair work - one yak does the work, the other brings another perspective,  provides backup, and is less of a risk to the one yak 
        - Marketing involvement in new [[Project Pitches]] process
            - How can we influence projects from the start - Setup for market success

        - insider peeks
        - marketing tactics (more than strategy?)
