- **Overview**
    - [BleepsDAO](https://bleeps.art/about/) is an attempt at encoding sound onto the Ethereum blockchain
    - Each Bleep is minted from a smart contract, using zero externalities, no backend, no ipfs, nor any client code
    - Each Bleep is effectively a [2-second sound of a pitch between C2 and D#7](https://bleeps.art/mint/)
    - There are seven instruments each covering this range
    - People are able to own a Bleep, with 75% of the proceeds going to the Bleeps DAO
    - The developer of the project is developing a melody generator that creators can use to make mint melodies using the Bleeps
    - Melodies are put on auction as they are minted by their creators
    - The revenue split for purchased melodies is Creator (90%), Bleepers (5%), and the DAO (5%)
    - The benefit of holding a Bleep is receiving a proportion of the Bleepers revenue for auction of melodies
    - Bleepers are entitled to one vote in governance matters, which might include minting new instruments, evolving the melody creator, and adapting the economic model
- **Speculative Future Developments**
    - Composability
    - It is possible to imagine the melodies produced being used as building blocks (or samples) for larger composition structures
    - Those compositions could have a similar economic revenue split model
    - In a very rudimentary sense, this could lay the groundwork for automatic on-chain management of royalties at the level of the sample
    - Interesting to think about what a similar model in a written context would be, with a particular lexicon for instance being developed and minted as verbal building blocks for essays
    - Also interesting to consider a forking of the Bleeps DAO open source code, and thus chains of sonic primitives competing based on economic and distributive terms
