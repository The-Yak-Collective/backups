        - Mission
            - Mission: Drop off a cheap rover that we are willing to lose, and operates for a few days at least (Rhett)
            - BIG mission constraint: Not on WiFi...
        - Discussion on whether or not to add a base station, what the mission means.
        - Some preliminary task/topic allocations.
        - Relevant to add making a PCB
            - Avoid wild and unreliable jumper wiring
            - Post-meeting extra: Sure on PCB, but after some time when clear that wiring layout and requirements are stable.
