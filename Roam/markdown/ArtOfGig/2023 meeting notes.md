        - Mission
            - Mission: Drop off a cheap rover that we are willing to lose, and operates for a few days at least (Rhett)
            - BIG mission constraint: Not on WiFi...
        - Discussion on whether or not to add a base station, what the mission means.
        - Some preliminary task/topic allocations.
        - Relevant to add making a PCB
            - Avoid wild and unreliable jumper wiring
            - Post-meeting extra: Sure on PCB, but after some time when clear that wiring layout and requirements are stable.

        - [Robotics Design Competition](https://coda.io/@nicolas-tzovanis/robotics-design-competition) by June 4th.
            - Possible 4h a week for a few people, using Flux.
            - First, a high-level component/ electrical diagram:

    - May 30
        - Discussion on component selection
        - We want to have imagery and sound.
        - Some times on seeing whether we can use modules like AudioMoth
    - June 6
        - Update on component diagram: https://excalidraw.com/#room=853043d2fdfce4feddd0,bpH5D2VZAphbU6TRvXI9_A
        - Can we select components already like an MCU, so software can start proceed (learning, trials)?
        - Converging to ESP32-S3 WROOM CAM board from Freenove
        - Software people can start looking into the board + Zephyr RTOS
        - Add solar and comms with Blues Notecarrier A (or F?)
        - Why not using a smartphone to replace all?
    - July 18
        - Software architecture stuff
        - Merits of using RTOS
    - July 25
        - Rhett early demo with FreeRTOS and esp-idf. Code for sending some telemetry over WiFi.
        - Is WiFi desired on Yakasaur?
            - Maybe good for mesh networking
            - Problem 2.4GHz is rather short range compared to what we can get at say 900MHz
        - Antenna?
            - About adding an external extra antenna for additional gain.
            - Molex antenna?
            - Antenna integrated in the body?
        - Discussion about cooling
            - Passive vs. active
            - Heat exchanger vs. refrigeration
            - Design ideas like putting solar panels on top, cover the whole rover and keep an air gap. A bit like Sojourner? https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/mars-sojourner/en/sojourner-movie.en.gif
