    - Initial reactions and discussions
        - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
            - Thermal System - 5% efficiency, 
            - high redundancy in telecommunications
            - Wheels are thin
            - leaks before failure systems engineering
            - simplest possible mission point A to point B
            - everything else fail, what is still possible,
            - when power is low, rover becomes communications outpost
            - "minimal stuff is communications systems" animals are design in that way
            - weather balloons were minimum or wind powered rover - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj-NqWDH2qE
            - "satellite coverage? " satellites takes images of rover
            - what might a 2032 rover might look like? 
        - [[Maier Fenster]]
            - Science Instruments - lots of chemical instruments
            - Thermal system - coolant leak problems?
            - #[[Venkatesh Rao]] - current thermal system is because  of operating range of temp on mars
            - book - thermal warriors talks about bugs, bumble bees, fly and stop operation, wasp liquid flow [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Warriors-Strategies-Insect-Survival/dp/0674883403/)
            - electronics should have own heating system
            - "What is the minimum viable rover? " 
            - tumble weed, wind is moving, very little communication, very little dynamic movement, banging into rocks 
            - radar imagery  - https://newatlas.com/space/planetary-radar-moon-images/
            - super minimalist rover - vortex of wind
        - [[Eric Platon]]
            - Difference between curiosity and perseverance, the warm electronics box, box is same in both
            - during descent the rover used two software for landing and roving
            - we don't need hard active communication.
        - [[Sachin Benny]]
            - complexity, rtg
            - impact probes, indian mission, cassini-huygens
        - [[Victor Hill]]
            - continuous draw of power, just staying alive takes a lot of power, 2025 50W output from RTG
            - inside of rover, everything is bulky, wondering if rover can smaller be made, 
            - #[[Maier Fenster]] - point of leak, how leaks are avoided, didn't see any loop to avoid leaks
        - [[Grigori Milov]]
            - What is the minimum viable rover? 
            - Energy source separate? 
            - Starts with thermal conditions on mars, difficult to build curiosity replica
            - design in two parts 
        - [[Praful Mathur]]
            - Erlang design - all design to fail, but still avoid systems failure
            - minimal stuff is communications systems
            - satellite coverage? 
            - passive movement 
            - ocean monitoring system, buoyes, shark research, different data collection system for ocean monitoring
            - payload cost  from 5000 dollars to 50 dollars in 10 years?
