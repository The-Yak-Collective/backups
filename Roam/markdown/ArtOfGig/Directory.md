- ###  How to jump in here 
- Minimalist version: 
    - Insert a page with your name in alphabetical order (by last name), and then do what you like with that page. 
        - [[Benito Berretta]] 
        - [[Rohit Krishnan]]
- High-usability version 
    - Allows people to read your page embedded within this page instead of jumping around:
        - Put a summary sentence/paragraph on your page. Create all additional content on your page indented under the first paragraph.
        - Copy the block ref of that summary paragraph
        - Embed (don't just copy) the block under your name on this page
            - Indented under your name on this page, start typing ```html
{{embed: ((Trivedi Girish))}}``` and then paste your block ref. It should end up looking something like this: ```clojure
{{embed: ((((Hello, my name is Girish Trivedi and Iam based in New Delhi , India. Iam a Consultant focused around technology, Media and Telecom vertical. I work on Growth strategies, Got to market strategies and Segmentation projects. I am also a transition coach for professionals in transition and on my way towards becoming ICF( International Coach Federation) certified coach.                 ))))}}```This will embed that summary paragraph and anything else under it here on this page. You can then edit it in either place.
        - If you'd like help with this (or just want it done for you), message @ScottAllenTVH on Discord.

This is all with the aim of enabling users to better accomplish their goals.
    - I hope to combine my expertise in behavioral science and gamification to help users improve their lives through products. Your users hire you to help them achieve some goal, but loving your product is a result of your teamwork with the user.[++]([[The role of the user and the role of the app]]) Both players need to play.

    - **Short Bio:** Located in Australia (near Melbourne) but these days I tend to work with clients outside of my country. My background is in instructional design, management consulting, training, change management, communications and management. 

My passion and focus is on learning & development and I'm also very interested in changing how we think about, define and "do" work.

My traditional consulting work has been:

1. Helping Learning & Development (L&D) departments up-skill and develop a org-wide strategy 
2. helping a business build (or rebuild) an L&D function 
3. designing L&D projects for large scale change (e.g. digital transformation)

__but__ I am much more interested in using my time now to really push the boundaries of using technology and art to accelerate people's development and growth.

Previously founder/CEO of Pure Learning (a digital learning and consulting company) and have been in consulting for 10 years.

    - Conceptual creative with a background in comparative literature, media labs, archives, conceptual art, experimental poetics, monetary art, communication & marketing, and financial technology. Believes that smart contractual primordial soup is genuine, & hedging our species against the entropic decay of both natural events, and the biases of masses, or atomic sub-DAOs such as an individual. 

Jumped on the decentralization orbit whilst contemplating (qualitatively) upon that MA thesis wherein a significant amount of futurist shit-posting flirts with longevity, digital objects, gaming, conceptual arts with blockchain technology in theory. 

Decided to learn what the heck that non-fungible format was, and is, at around early 2020 without any prior knowledge of financial technology, composability, game theory, coordination etc. (The Smiths—Sweet and Tender Hooligan intervenes). Been minting, trading, and actively power-using anything decentralized since then. Some say he an artist, others gym shark.
