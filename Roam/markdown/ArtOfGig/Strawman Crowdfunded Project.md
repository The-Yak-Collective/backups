- Title: **Internet of Rovers**
- Short Description: Infrastructure and backend for an internet of rovers, along with a reference design for a basic low-cost ($500-$1000 depending on configuration), open-source, modular and extensible rover design with social capabilities designed to serve as a default node on the IoR
    - [[Maier Fenster]] consider add-on to existing rover, prompt school, place to join own rover, "parts you can add to a rover", rover or drone?
        - we also need a definition of the audience and what problem we solve for them, and us
        - a lot of the below does not fit in $500-$1000. and maybe that is a lot for some hobbyists. 
    - [[Rhett Garber]] what do you do with an Internet of Rovers?
        - Exploration as a service
        - Rent a Rover?
            - Want a big rover
    - Anuraj
        - bare metal rover... like SMARS
    - Brian
        - Location over rover design itself
    - Venkat
        - Service-oriented roverics (Eg: find me all bugs in the garden)
- Reference examples
    - Drone network ... run a drone on a map
- Rough specs -- internet of rovers
    - Published API for rovers to join the Internet of Rovers
    - Published specs for rovers to be conformant to the IoR
    - System Software
        - Docker containers for supported compute options
        - Basic navigation and control library (forked from some standard)
        - Python-based extension support
        - [[Maier Fenster]] open source demos downloaded by container and working at once can be a strong selling point
    - Communications
        - Connect to Yak Rover global VPN via any WiFi access point
        - Ability to expose sensing and control capabilities to trusted network
        - Capacity for SDR-based connectivity
    - Social
        - Global registry mechanism for joining/discovery and capability sharing
    - Economic
        - Simple Ethereum-lite based sidechain token economy connected to Ethereum mainnet via a bridge node
        - Unique naming system for all rovers, each with an associated 1/n NFT for governance rights
    - [[Maier Fenster]] seem to be missing that "thing" which makes it an internet for  & by rovers. what do rovers get from it
- Rough specs -- standard modular reference rover (though Internet of Rovers will be open to any conforming design)
    - [[maier fenster]] we provide the standard parts?
    - Mission: Indoor roving on a home or office class wifi network
    - Size: About a shoebox
    - Weight: < 2kg
    - Mechanical: 
        - Tripod/pentoid main body with 3/4 single-joint articulated limb joints to enable both wheeled and walking type mobility
            - quadruped walking is easy
            - might be able to do transformers style biped walking too
        - Support for a variety of main compute boards and breakout boards
        - Standard basic wheel unit and leg unit designs  
        - A payload deck able to hold a variety of sensor and actuator payloads
        - [[Maier Fenster]] need more details on what modular means
    - Mobility: 
        - Wheel units (usable in tricycle or 4WD config): 
            - DC drive motors (probably N20) with hall effect sensors drive wheel unit
            - Passive wheels with SG90 or similar steering servo
            - Combo wheels with both drive and steering
        - Walking only: 4x2=8 joint servos 
        - Combo: both
    - Power:
        - 12V main power (4s LiPo) up to 8A
        - Optional capacity for solar panel extension
        - [[maier fenster]] self-charging an important issue
    - Wire harness
        - All main drive and servo motors independently powered via breakout boards on 12V power bus
        - All peripheral cabling on DuPont connectors
        - Board-to-harness cabling dependent on board selected
        - i2C bus and 3.3/5v power rails integrated into payload deck
    - Compute
        - Support for
            - Raspberry Pi 4 with TBD robotics hat, possibly Adafruit Crickit
            - Beaglebone Blue
            - Maybe Arduino Mega??
        - Support for optional Oak-D lite camera
        - Support for Nvidia Jetson Nano as either main board or ancillary board
    - Basic payload peripheral choices
        - Static camera mount
            - Standard USB cameras
            - Oak-D lite
        - Ultrasonic ranging sensor
    - Advanced peripherals
        - 2-axis camera gimbal mount
        - 1+1 dof gripper (1 active joint + 1 gripper solenoid)
