        - On Religion Ways 2040 that dove tails into what happened at Zoom call with Kernel May 26th 2020  
        - Sharing some thoughts / speculative note
        - Humans develop (evolve?) shared conceptual frameworks (what such frameworks consist of etc obviously needs drilling down) to navigate complexity, especially unknown unknowns. Lets call it Complexity Navigating Conceptual Framework (CNCF).
        - When a current CNCF fails to perform over some period of time (a few decades? Centuries?), then a new CNCF arises.
        - 
        - 
        - Through 15th – 16th century Science / Scientific Method developed / evolved into the new CNCF, which proved to be more productive than the Religion CNCF. Newtonian physics provided a stable lens to apply this CNCF. Lets call it Newtonian CNCF.
        - Over the last century, with theory of relativity / quantum physics enabling nuclear fission and fusion based applications and subsequent computing methods and hardware designs, Newtonian CNCF was found wanting in its ability to help navigate known unknowns (particle physics?) and not helpful to monitor emergence of unknown unknowns. Newtonian CNCF was too structured. Something else, a new CNCF, needed to begin evolving.
        - What we see evolving now is what I call a Probabilistic CNCF, which uses analysis of large amounts of data using extensive computing power to attempt to develop ways of explaining known unknowns as probabilistic patterns – and then pushing the envelope to open up unknown unknowns. The first manifestation of Probabilistic CNCF is Big Data – AI based architecture.
        - By 2040 Probabilistic CNCF is likely to be the dominant CNCF. Newtonian CNCF will also continue to play a role, as will Religion CNCF (which has continued to play a role in the last 400 years). So multiple CNCFs are in play at any given time, one of them being in the lead and gradually gaining dominance.

    - Brief History of Religion - Richard Holloway
        - What is religion?
        - Where does it come from?
        - Why do humans seem to need it? 
        - Why is it so associated with violence and intolerance? 
        - In the simplest of terms, religion feeds our appetite for hope – whether it be building communities around shared rituals and beliefs, creating an ultimate dispenser of justice, or just imagining life after life.
        - The anvil that has worn out many hammers
    - Seven Ways of Looking at Religion -Benjamin Schewel
        - Subtraction - which is based on the idea that religion is a way of coping with the conditions of ignorance, powerlessness, and cultural passivity that characterized early human existence. Following this rationale, as humanity’s knowledge, power, and pace of cultural change advance, as is evidently happening in the modern world, humanity should become less and less religious. Classical theories of secularization exemplify the subtraction narrative well.  (Daniel Dennett, John Dewey, and Marcel Gauchet)
        - Renewal - Renewal narratives root the problems of modernity in humanity’s departure from some religious truth that was better known to inhabitants of an earlier time and argue that we can only solve our problems by reengaging this truth today.(Alasdair MacIntyre, Martin Heidegger, and Muhammad Iqbal)
        - Transsecular - which claims that modernity does not stimulate religion’s marginalization and decline, but rather its transformation. (Charles Taylor, Rodney Stark, and Monica Toft )
        - Postnaturalist - , which focuses on the relationship between science and religion. These narratives claim that modern science rightfully disrupted premodern views of nature but has been unnecessarily burdened by an ideological association with naturalism. They then argue that recent developments in natural-scientific theory actually help us consider the place of certain spiritual forces in nature anew. (Thomas Nagel, Hans Jonas, and Pim van Lommell.)
        - Construct- which argues that a general concept of religion (one that sees religion as a universal phenomenon that is variously instantiated throughout history and around the world) was developed by modern Western thinkers and then projected onto others. Construct narratives evaluate whether or to what extent this notion of religion was a discovery, an illusion, the mask of an expansionary political endeavor, or a mix of all three. (Talal Asad, Guy Stroumsa, and Jason Josephson)
        - Perennial - which claims that all the world’s religions exhibit common dynamics. Although advocates of the Perennial Philosophy and various New Age enthusiasms operate within the perennial narrative framework, a much broader range of perspectives fall within this category as well. ( Aldous Huxley, John Hick, and Rudolf Otto,)
        - construct perennial, and developmental.
    - Evolution of Religion - Individual experience Vs Group Conformity ( Power play)
        - Regardless of what other peripheral duties they had, though, all shamans across the globe had one job in particular — acting as a bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds.
        - Origins of Organized Religion - Whenever tribal societies transitioned into more structured ones, the roles of shamans seemed to diminish. They were largely replaced with priests
            - Instead, perhaps brought about by the invention of writing, priests taught codified stories about deities and pantheons untouchable by mortal men. Spirits turned into gods. 
            - Shamans wearing the heads and skins of animals to channel their spirits turned into hybrid man-beast deities. Religion became less of a mechanism for communities to tackle their problems and more of a mechanism for the ruling class to exert control over their subjects.
        - As time progressed, the role of the individual in organized religion had, at first glance, largely died out among advanced peoples. As priests were doing very little to connect people with their gods by that time, the prophets took this position for themselves.
        - They facilitated the transition from polytheism to monotheism. Prophets, as far as we can tell, always only claimed to speak to one god in particular. Thus, if one prophet’s message grew particularly popular, their corresponding god would grow popular alongside them. 
        - After this, there have been always questions of prominence of one sect over other, balkanization of religion is clear
        - Religious institutions are losing power to the attractive prospect of direct religious experience again in 21 century
        - The shamanism -- of the ancient world was centered around an idea that sounds foreign to the modern ear — direct religious experience. People didn’t have doctrinal books or church services.
            - There is a spirit in every physical being, and this spirit could be contacted directly by the shaman through the entering of a trance or an otherwise altered state of consciousness. This was the central tenet of shamanism.
        - The ritual behavior seen in collective worship makes us enjoy and want to repeat the experience. Dancing, singing and achieving trance
    - Religion <--> Individual
        - Inner peace
        - Ethical behaviour
        - Not being alone in this universe
        - Feeling secure
        - Asking for forgiveness 
        - Escape from suffering
        - Psychological susceptibility to belief in God is the result of adaptive design - Has it helped us to be successful genetically ?
        - An accidental by-product of human cognitive evolution, a function less leftover of the capacity to reason about other human minds in the everyday social world
        - Religious belief is an exaptation a spandrel that turned out to be useful and so was subsequently selected for by evolutionary forces
        - Strongly believe there is a certain limitations to what we perceive as reality and there is a strong external authority above all the reality that we currently perceive. Religious activities are mainly a way of moving away from the current reality and move in to another reality (which we do not currently perceive with 5 senses) and communicate with this external authority
        - Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) proposes that a powerful affectional bond forms between an infant and the
infant’s primary caretakers, usually the parents, during the
early stages of life. The primary purpose of this bond is for
maintaining security and safety for the vulnerable child.
Bowlby (1979) theorized that the child forms internal working models (IWM) of both self and others that reflect the
degree of security or insecurity experienced in the parent–
child bond. He further theorized that the characteristics of
those bonds and subsequent IWMs influence the quality of
one’s relationships with others and one’s sense of self over
the life span
        - Cognitive Decoupling: Humans tend to form relationships and attachment with other humans. 
        - Ability to  anthropo-morphise objects.
        - Religion in search of hope
        - All our inner experiences have a neurological foundation, even if we are still in the dark about the details of those foundations
    - Religion <---> Group, Community
        - Is there any collective religious ritual without at least one of song, dance, visual drama( ), scents
        - Acts of social unity - Bonding -Endorphin
        - Social Cohesion 
        - “Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FxPjNiALl9C.png?alt=media&token=7f6d223f-b4c9-479a-a26b-d3b5e0da9eed)
        - First, our ancestors evolved certain mental abilities, useful for survival and reproduction, which predisposed them to religious beliefs. Then, from the multitude of beliefs that emerged, particular religions spread and persisted because their deities and rituals promoted cooperation among practitioners. 
        - Human capacities helped formation of religion: Seek patterns, infer intentions ( Theory of Mind) and learn by imitation.
        - For brains that seem wired to find agency and intention everywhere, religion comes very naturally.
        - Full Access Agency theory
        - Endorphin-triggering activation on collective large scale
        - Paul Tillich, one of the most famous 20th Century theologians, developed a theology of correlation: the answers religion has to offer should correspond to the questions that a culture is asking. If it fails at this endeavour, then it becomes irrelevant. Much of the loudest theology preached by the loudest practitioners of religion seems to have failed in precisely this way. So many people have decided to take their questions elsewhere.
        - But the questions remain. As do we – human animals whose brains “have been designed to blur the line between self and other”, as de Waal puts it. We’re always going to seek out activities – trance dance, prayer, communion – that remind us of and enhance this blur.
    - Religious violence - Power dynamics
        - Why is it so associated with violence and intolerance? What are the similarities and differences between the many manifestations of religions thought?
        - Violence purportedly carried out in the name of God,  is nearly always in reality caused by other factors – political, social, racial and economic - Karen Armstrong
    - Thoughts on how will Neuro Tech might evolve by 2040
        - Scale of usage - A billion brains using it
        - Extended period of use for multiple purposes at different settings not just religious
            - Purpose : Business, Social, Spiritual
            - Settings: Lonely, Group ( some people with tech, some people without Tech)
        - Presence of Neuro Tech interrupting our own activities ( Bio feedback)
        - Brain adapting, evolving and course correcting itself
    - Religious activities and effect on brain
        - Is religion and faith a creation of brain or Faith helped evolve brain as it is today ?
        - Functional scans of Japanese monks show that different types of meditation stimulate different areas of the brain, namely parts of the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. Religious belief is also associated with reduced reactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as is political conservatism. Although the causality of these correlations isn’t clear, it’s interesting that taking initiatives, by contrast, is associated with increased activity in the ACC. 
        - The EEGs of Carmelite nuns have shown marked changes during mystical experiences when they felt they were at one with God. In a state like this, individuals may also feel as if they have found the ultimate truth, lost all sense of time and space, are in harmony with mankind and the universe, and are filled with peace, joy, and unconditional love. 
        - Neuropharmacological studies show how crucial the activation of the dopamine reward system is in such experiences. In this context, brain disorders are also instructive. Alzheimer’s disease, for instance, is linked to the progressive loss of religious interest. The more slowly it progresses, the less religiousness and spirituality are affected. 
        - Conversely, hyperreligiosity is associated with fronto-temporal dementia, mania, obsessive-compulsive behavior, schizophrenia, and temporal lobe epilepsy. A number of these disorders are known to make the dopamine reward system more active.

        - Carmelite nuns were asked to remember their most mystical Christian experience while undergoing functional scans. The scans showed a complex activation pattern of brain areas. Activation occurred in (1) the center of the temporal lobe, possibly relating to the feeling of being one with God (this region is also activated in temporal lobe epilepsy, sometimes causing intense religious experiences); (2) the caudate nucleus (an area in which emotions are processed), possibly relating to the feeling of joy and unconditional love; and (3) the brain stem, insular cortex, and prefrontal cortex, possibly relating to the bodily and autonomic reactions that go with these emotions and cortical consciousness of them. Finally, the parietal cortex was also activated, possibly relating to the feeling of changes in the body map similar to those in near-death experiences
        - Neuroscience research supports the idea that the brain is primed to believe, says Jordan Grafman, PhD, director of the cognitive neuroscience section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. This tendency, he says, is spread throughout the brain, and probably arose from neural circuits developed for other uses.
        - What may make religion different from mundane thoughts about one’s parents are contemplative traditions, such as meditation and prayer, which have the potential to change how the brain is wired among regular practitioners, says University of Wisconsin psychologist Richard Davidson, PhD. His work using both fMRI and EEG to measure brain activity of long-term Buddhist meditation practitioners during meditation shows that they have a stronger and better organized attention system than people who are just learning how to meditate. In essence, meditation — and perhaps any contemplative spiritual practice — enhances attention and turns off the areas of the brain that focus on the self.
        - Meditation is a family of mental exercises that change the circuits in the brain involved in regulation of emotion and attention
        - These findings mesh with a large body of research and clinical reports that religious people are less prone to depression and anxiety, says Plante, editor of the book “Contemplative Practices in Action: Spirituality, Meditation, and Health” (APA, 2010). “Adaptive spiritual practices can be a foil to anxiety and depression,” Plante says.
Having spiritual beliefs might also lead to enjoying a longer, healthier life. A large body of research finds that religious people live longer, are less prone to depression, are less likely to abuse alcohol and drugs, and even go to the dentist more often. Inzlicht’s research might provide a partial explanation for these findings, says University of Miami psychologist Michael McCullough, PhD.
        - One study found that paranormal believers tended to perceive more intentionality in randomly moving objects and that this bias was associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) – a core region of the theory-of-mind network (Riekki et al.,2014)
        - People reflecting on their religious beliefs, for example, show increased activation in their theory-of-mind (ToM) networks (Kapogiannis et al., 2009)
        - fMRI study found that seeing more “meaning” in random pictures among paranormal believers was associated with reduced activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, which means that enhanced intentionality detection could also be in part due to reduced cognitive inhibition (Lindeman, Svedholm, Riekki, Raij, & Hari 2013)
        - Spiritual experiences cause changes in brain activity, which is logical and neither proves nor disproves the existence of God. After all, everything we do, think, and experience provokes such changes. Findings of this kind merely increase our understanding of the various brain structures and systems that play a role in both “normal” religious experiences and the type of religious experience that is a symptom of certain neurological or psychiatric disorders.
    - **The many futures of Religion with advances in Neuro Tech**
        - Brain response during religious activities tend to have a distinct spectra and it is can be correlated to certain behaviors and humans can be classified into distinct groups based on these traits (each of these groups might show very similar responses during business, familial, trade settings). This information can be used for targeted marketing, powerplay etc.
        - Kernel signals can be used to recommend a particular religious activity based on present state of mind
            - 10 min meditation for a particular spectra
            - Visit a religious gathering for a particular spectra etc..
        - Brain - Brain communication might reveal other person's religious belief without explicitly enquiring
        - **Religious Extremism**: 
            - To sample spectra from religious extremists to create a profile of potential religious extremists.
            - Using this on large population to estimate the probability of a certain person turning into an extremism. 
        - **Neuro-Tech is the Future Priest**: 
            - Identify how brain responds during religious activities to create new combination religious activities which trigger better emotional responses or other economical activities which trigger similar responses.
