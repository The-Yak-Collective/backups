- Fiction/artwork concept design
- Realistic useful scenarios, not on Mars, but on the way there
    - Inflection points
- Technical
    - Feasibility study
        - Ranking of exploration targets
        - Self-replication
        - System boundaries/system of systems -- for larger goals like terraforming, multiple rovers/infrastructure etc
        - "Earthmoving" on Mars (Marsmoving??) -- canals, foundations, caves, roads.... etc etc. -- what specific things do you need to do this set of building activities
        - Gophers and bats (subterranean and air)
        - Soil of mars = 1% perchlorate == perchlorate energy/work idea
            - Generalize to what could you make with raw materials on mars/anywhere
            - Moon -- sinter the regoliths to make mechanical parts
            - methane based fuel on Mars
            - What can you do with water (south pole of moon, mars)
    - Virtual teardown
        - Virtual environment -- use Nasa material 
        - Reverse engineer capabilities to build rover
        - Goal is to identify pieces we are overlooking or not looking into enough
    - Bill of material 
        - ESA ExoMy BoM in Discord
