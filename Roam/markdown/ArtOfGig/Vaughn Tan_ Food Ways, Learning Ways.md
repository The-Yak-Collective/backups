- for [[Sachin Benny: Order Ways]] I'm looking at what an economy around third party learning may look like - micropayments for accessing someone else's API to their brain

- overall considerations
    - correlational analyses require independent and dependent variables
    - neural activity measures are both independent and dependent variables
        - another way to frame the question is: what are the dependent variables that might be of interest as being inferentially causally connected to neural activity measures?
        - also: what are the contexts in which it would be interesting/valuable to collect neural activity data?
        - also: what are the forms in which neural activity data might be interesting?
- Food Ways (initial free-association topics)
    - hyperspecificity and individuation of neuro-optimisation
    - supplementation
        - nootropics that work primarily biochemically through more- or less-understood pathways
        - custom supplementation tailored to individual neuro/biochemistry
        - tailoring to ways and states of thinking: eg tea-drunk,
    - what does premium look
        - the normalisation of the hypernatural
        - hypertechnical
    - "flavoured" supplement
        - style in relation to supplementation ("i want what tim ferriss is on")
        - curation in re supp (HUO for supplementations)
        - endorsement dynamics (identifying elective clusters of convergent taste in supplementation)
    - downregulation as a desired temporary state: when everyone is in cogn turbomode all the time, supplementation can be to reduce capacity. (like the culture glanding __calm__ or __stupid__)
- Learning Ways (initial free-association topics)
    - multiple possible directions of travel
        - learning of high-level cognition as competitive advantage; low-level content-acquisition and processing as outsourced work
        - learning for affective
        - learning for interpretive work as competitive advantage; formal logico-cognitive work being outsourced
        - learning for relational work
    - third party learning
        - remote (ie mediated) use of someone else's tacit knowledge
            - knowing-how
        - remote (ie mediated) use of someone else's affective responses
            - as in therapy
        - remote (ie mediated) use of someone else's explicit knowledge
            - about fact
            - about process
    - remote (ie mediated) use of someone else's memory
    - rented learning
        - "external memory" tools
        - "memory as a service"
    - (literal) consumption of knowledge:
        - RNA learning
            - from others previous time-periods (katras)
            - from others in the future
        - from others in same time-period
