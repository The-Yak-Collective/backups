        - There's something interesting in Chris' comment (below), particularly at the intersection of death & ageing. It would be fascinating to create a digital approximation of a person who died young that ages alongside their peers, informed by data gathered from older people with similar neuro-profiles [[Amanda Reeves: Age Ways]]
            - "Assuming we can do that, I think that'd be a really interesting literalization of someone living on in the hearts and minds of others after death. That sounds like a big possible culture shift in attitudes towards death- the cessation of new episodes of YourLife, but with reruns continuing in syndication. I assume the deceased would insist on being the curator while alive. It could be a natural evolution of social media curation- we've all probably seen Facebook accounts turn to mausoleums over the years. [[Chris Reid]]"

    - I’d really like to learn more about the subjective mental state of the last minutes. Does your life really flash in front of your eyes, etc? I can imagine a neuro-death ritual practice, where people die broadcasting their last mental states. Macabre perhaps but a sort of death-twitter where a kernel device broadcasts interpretations of last stages (emotions, memory region, pain...) -- [[Venkatesh Rao]]

- basics / notes from readings 
    - speculative fiction, generative "what if" questions
    - venkat suggestion:  
        - Start with your assigned folkway, for example: **naming ways**
        - Imagine a **NORMAL** (not early adopter) pattern of use of Kernel-like technology, for example, **using brain scan data to identify people**
        - Imagine one or more highly likely adjacent trends, **such as biometrics or blockchain-based identity schemes**
        - Imagine an interesting/generative “traffic jam” between them:** example: conflict between neuro-id and facial-recognition-id.**
        - Describe it in an evocative/provocative form **(ideally a single cartoon panel)**
        - Find and add 2-3 interesting source (essays, books, movies) that might help a reader develop their intuitions and imagination around the future of that folkway: example, **articles on naming**
    - pretty much making a mapping between brain imaging & neural nets 
        - correlatory 
    - the future of machine learning will be a direction as important to look to as neuroscience/neuroimaging itself
