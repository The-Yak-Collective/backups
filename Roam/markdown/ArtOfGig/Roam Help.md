- We're all on the learning curve with Roam lol. There seems to be a tipping point where befuddlement or frustration shifts into flying around in a way other text editors don’t let you. 
- This February 2020 post on __A Text Renaissance__ by [[Venkatesh Rao]] is useful for a high-level why-bother carrot:

- Following are resources someone here has found useful. Part of the beauty of this shared Roam graph is that you can add anything below that you found useful since someone else probably will too.

    - YouTubers have jumped on Roam. Here's a sampler of vids that you might find helpful, in increasing levels of complexity.

- [[Roam Newsletter]] [[August 18th, 2020]]
    - **Weekly U****pdate:**** New shortcuts, filter search, and more...**
    - Hey Roamans, we've made a bunch of great improvements to the Roam experience this week that we want to introduce you to!
    - **New shortcuts**
    - You asked and we delivered. You can now open page and block mentions directly in the sidebar using CMD-Shift-Click on macOS and Meta/Ctrl-Shift-Click on Windows (pst, Ctrl- works now on Windows :D).
    - We've also added the ability to open the graph overview of a page by Alt-Shift-Clicking on a reference. Finally, we've added a long-asked-for feature: Shift-Clicking on Daily Notes now opens the current day's note in the sidebar!

    - **Search your filters**
    - We've also made it a lot easier to quickly filter your pages and backlinks through a new  search bar that appears whenever you've got too many references to see in one glance.

    - **Community Updates**
    - Nat Eliason, who we've partnered with before, has just launched a new and improved version of his immensely popular Effortless Output in Roam course. [Join Nat on a journey towards to Roam mastery](https://cwhitesullivan.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=e0d36e3e95b58c6ad79890bdef9c8605&i=67A772A1A342)!
    - And Tracy Winchell, who helped moderate a couple of our office hours this past week has released a tutorial video highlighting how she uses Roam to crush self-doubt. [Check it out here](https://cwhitesullivan.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=e0d36e3e95b58c6ad79890bdef9c8605&i=67A772A1A343).

    - **One more thing...******We've made some incredibly exciting updates to block references in the past week. While some of you have may already have noticed these new features and started incorporating them into your note-taking practices, we're going to have a demo later this week showing you all how to take advantage of the new update to make templates, track how your thoughts change over time, and more!
    - For now, you can open the new block reference menu by simply clicking on a referenced block, as shown below:
