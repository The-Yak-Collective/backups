- I'm a web developer/designer trading as http://engaging.net surprised that a book entitled __Enterprise Ontology__ (by Jan L. G Dietz) is just what I was looking for despite the equations and whatnot.
- Re tech:
    - Current
        - **Nuxt** https://nuxtjs.org as the web framework
        - **Strapi** https://strapi.io as the [[Back-end]]
        - **Apollo** https://apollo.vuejs.org/ as the glue between them
    - Legacy
        - **ExpressionEngine** https://expressionengine.com as the monolithic content management system
        - **jQuery** https://jquery.com as the JavaScript leg-up
