This page provides some tips and tricks for running meetings.
# Roles
    - ## MC
        - **This is the only __required__ role.** Someone needs to actually __run__ the meeting, right?
        - The MC's job is to keep everyone on-track.
            - Set the agenda and keep things moving.
            - Watch the time.
            - Make sure everyone has a chance to speak. (This means encouraging people who are quiet and gently moving on from people who are taking up more than their fair share of airtime.)
        - For ongoing meetings, rotate who's MC'ing.
            - But keep in mind that the MC is the most prominent, visible role, and not everyone may want it. While people should be encouraged to stretch their wings and MC, nobody should be __required__ to do so!
    - ## Note-Taker
        - **Most [[Yak Collective]] meetings should have someone who takes notes.**
        - The note-taker should generally be its own role.
            - We've found from experience that it's hard to both take good notes and perform another function (like live streaming or MC'ing).
            - It's important that the note-taker spend most of their time carefully listening to the other participants, rather than thinking of what to say next. __For this reason, the note-taker will often be in listen-only mode.__
        - Just because you're taking notes doesn't mean that you don't need to be familiar with the agenda or reading being discussed. If anything, taking good notes means that you need to be __more__ familiar with these things so that you can more easily relate other people's ideas to the meting's source material!
        - For ongoing meetings, rotate who has the note-taker role.
            - Since it's difficult for the note-taker to also effectively participate, it can be a somewhat isolating position. Rotating who has this duty will help make sure that no one feels like they're being boxed out of the conversation.
    - ## Videographer
        - **Some [[Yak Collective]] meetings are live streamed or otherwise recorded.** If that's your meeting, then there should be a dedicated role in charge of this.
        - The videographer doesn't have a listening-intensive role like the [note-taker](((zSHeBHEGG))), it's still a role that takes some concentration.
            - If you're in this role, expect to be able to contribute less than the average participant.
            - It's unlikely that you'll need to be in listen-only mode, however, unless you're managing a particularly complicated video setup.
        - Ideally the videographer role would rotate among participants as well.
            - Unfortunately, we have very few people with the skill set necessary to fulfill this role.

# Pre-Meeting Prep Work
    - Meeting materials should be posted in the appropriate Discord channel the night before the meeting (or possibly even a few days before, for more involved topics).
        - Use `/tfurl` to cross-post into [#voice-meta](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720) the day of the meeting. (Cross-posting early risks the information being lost in the chat from other meetings.)
    - If you're going to be recording or live-streaming the meeting, create a dedicated thread in the appropriate channel (__not [#voice-meta](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720)!__). This can be used by streaming tools like OBS to provide a nice header for the meeting chat.
        - Even if you're not going to be recording your meeting, it's still worth considering doing this, as it helps keep the meeting chat organized and won't get lost after the meeting like the temporary thread in the voice channel.
# During the Meeting
    - For study groups, we've found that dedicating the first 10 - 20 minutes of the meeting to collective, silent reading helps to improve participation and meeting quality. If you don't do this already, you're encouraged to give it a try!
