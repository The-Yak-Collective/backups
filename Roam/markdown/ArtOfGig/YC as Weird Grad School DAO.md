        - think "continuing legal education" (or medical)
        - i think also should look at  https://glazkov.com/adt-primer/ about adult education

- a modern non-school is y-combinator - combining theoretical and practical application. grade is provided by the world. [[Maier Fenster]]
    - PA I think that explicitly riffing off YC might not be a bad thing. I was paintballing with a bunch of recent YC founders Sunday and it was kinda amazing how commoditity they've become.
