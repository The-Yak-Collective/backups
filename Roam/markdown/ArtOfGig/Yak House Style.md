- So you're making a Yak web page, presentation, app? Here's what we're doing lately.  
    - ## Accessibility. 
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Nothing here, but how much can we get out of the box? 
    - ## Text. 
        - page text is mostly the responsibility of the individual projects.
        - Yak Words (our meaning, usage). 
            - Yak ()
            - YC ()
            - Yak Collective ()
                - Yak Collective vs. The Yak Collective. 
            - Yakster ()
            - Yakking ()
            - Yak Shaver ()
            - Yak Herder ()
        -  Tired consulting words 
            - salient 
    - ## Yak brand logos, icons, symbols, signatures, etc. 
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Yak art to use in your presentations and publications. 
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Templates for common documents. 
    - ## Base style. 
        - Tachyons (https://tachyons.io/). Use the built-in tachyons classes whenever possible. Break this rule to preserve code readability or to keep things simple.
    - ## Fonts. 
        - "noto serif"
        - "playfair display" used for headings. 
        - "font awesome" for icons.
    - ## Colors. 
        - white (rgba(255,255,255,1.0)) 
        - almost-black (rgba(15,15,15,1.0)). 
        - These are specified as rgba rather than hex because we create shades of gray by changing the opacity, rather than selecting a set of hex colors. Links use 0.8, 0.2 for borders and de-emphasized text, 0.05 for shaded backgrounds. 
        - We let pages flip colors for a "dark mode". Used for the slides in [[future frontiers]] (which then sub out the background color). But it is actually a more general capability.
    - ## CSS
        - CSS Classes. you can find most of the css here: https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/tree/netlify-prod/css 
        - Generated CSS. there's a little bit of per-page css that's generated in the header at build time (lines 165 - 266; coding is liquid, but should be decipherable even if you're not super-familiar): https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/blob/netlify-prod/_layouts/default.html
