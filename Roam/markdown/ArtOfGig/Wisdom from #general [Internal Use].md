- I'm looking to transition from corporate to indie by taking an intermediate step and angling for a consultant type role within the company. Struggling to work out how to go about it (or if its even a good idea).- [[Yoni Balkind]]

    - Problem Solving vs. Capacity Building
"the consultant label is meaningless - instead what you want is the ability to build a new capability for the org. So pitch that - pitch stepping away from managing existing business functions and build something new. That's often the role of the consultant and if you can do that you'll get a taste of indie work. At the same time - don't forget to talk publicly about the transition. Building a network and profile is crucial for the transition to indie”
This is a good read on the difference between problem solving and capacity building. Many folks imagine themselves being problem solvers but it's much better to be a capacity builder: https://thesystemsthinker.com/consultants-as-problem-solvers-or-capacity-builders/
"mulling this advice I might revise my answer. If you're serious about transitioning to indie life I think the single most valuable thing your current role gives you is a steady paycheck and air cover (financially and emotionally) to build towards indie nights/weekends. Building a network, getting the word out, building up your indie instincts. These are more valuable than role playing as a consultant inside your existing org. Double down on the middle manager easy brainless job and take the paycheck and build up reserves for the leap
I think it's straightforward to articulate but hard to pull off - like running every day. Simply starting a wiring practice- documenting your thinking and ideas
I think the key things writing (i.e. blogging) gives you is: a) an awareness that you're "for hire" and b) what projects you would be a good fit for. You're basically looking to maximise the number of people who could make a good intro for you when an opportunity arises. [[Tom Critchlow]]
    - Yep, often “internal consultants” tend to be part of a new capability initiative like six sigma and float around helping other teams acquire the capability as coaches. But be aware that such roles often mean “employee-ier than thou”. It may not serve as a bridge to free agency unless you acquire externally valuable certifications etc. Threading that needle is non-trivial. You want to rude something that’s both a broad industry trend and a local capability need, and position internally and externally (go to meetups, write blogs etc) at the same time [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - keep in mind that if you can build new capabilities in one place, you can do so in others - those skills are hardly specific to the org at hand, rather transferable - and, most importantly, billable.if it involves building the same capacity in another org, make sure you retain the IP to the playbook (especially documentation, task layout, etc) and don't violate NDAs and/or non-competes retaining the IP entails creating it in your own time on your own hardware, etc

    - building on what tom and vgr said, if your company doesn't already have an internal consulting group, it may be more frustrating and you'd learn less than just going solo and having the pressure to level-up on your own. It may be a decent option IF: - you can work directly for a c-level + you and him would have the credibility and cover to shift into a role (which could work especially if they are ex-consultant) - there is an existing group that has a good project management capability (most internal groups suck and do random reactive stuff in my experience) Alternatively, one option you might want to consider is to find a pro-bono, low fee or even regular fee if you can do it client on the side to put the pressure on yourself. You'll get to test out whether you can quickly level up your consulting skillset + also see if you like the responsibility of being in such a role [[Paul Millerd]]
    - some posts that got me some conversations with prospects for product marketing work. Both are from my contracting work days, so a bit old -

- Reading this made me think that the peacetime/wartime CEO analogy is not right for indies... What are the modes indies can drop into? What should be the mindset change during these times for indies? - [[Tom Critchlow]]
https://taylorpearson.me/crisis-management-plan/
    - haven't read the piece yet, but personally, i am going into what i call "Maroon Mode": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Maroons will read this and flesh that out more fully either here or maybe a blog post.
i think a lot of ICs don't realize that they have a wealth of experience here, in helping clients navigate uncertainty.
am only just realizing this myself
suggested tagline: "making sense when things do not" - [[Alex Wagner]]
    - agree "wartime" doesn't feel right. I think a lot of the training for downturns comes from the behaviors indies gain in "peace" time because our mode of being is so different than that of the FTE. If anything, we need to shift to be the steady hand, default to giving without expectation, keep showing up etc... It seems that many indies who have been solo for a while deal with uncertainty all the time so they have experience to help clients think about this. If anything, just write... [[Paul Millerd]]
- Hey there - does anyone have any examples of consulting companies shifting from fee-based work to a subscription model. Helping a client pressure test this idea. - [[Paul Millerd]]
    - This might be obvious but there's always the coaching model. I do some sales outreach training with a client once a week over zoom for a small retainer amount. It's relatively low-stress and kind of fun(for me, ymmv). Wouldn't mind having a few more clients like this. another idea that i pitched to this client – they're a boutique web dev/information architecture shop – is selling "consulting sprints", where the founder and maybe a dev, or maybe a project manager, could be contracted on a subscription basis to go in and tear down aspects of a company's site(on a dev/engineering level) and give recommendations to their in-house team. riffing here
was working with this client to think about how they might productize senior web dev/IA services in a super saturated field. client definitely has the expertise to consult, but new to the consulting model - [[Alex Wagner]]
    - What distinguishes subscription from a fee? I don’t know if that’s that, but I like the model of tptacek’s Latacora - @anton
    - I looked into this at one point. Research retainer-based business models. Often found in accounting/tax prep/legal advice. Fee is after use. Subscription is for access, irrespective of using / or not. At one point I wondered if it'd be worthwhile to do systems administration / systems engineering (commonly smeared as DevOps these days) on a retainer-basis, but so far Cloudwork has proved more profitable - [[Johannes "xmj" Meixner]]
- Career/(gig?) metaphors....so whats' ur version of this ? I have in the past thought of prostitution ..these days think of the girlfriend experience. Now reconsidering if it's time to pick an alternative idea,
    - yikes at girlfriend experience... I think that's a dangerous metaphor for the gig economy and likely means you don't have a sustainable personal passion to feed and should probably take a job instead if you can.
a good diagnostic question to ask is: who are you when you are NOT dependent on clients. Eg. you have a big quarter and end up with a big surplus that allows you to not work for 6 months or a year. What do you do? Any sort of prostitution/mercenary type metaphor will leave you directionless under surplus. So you want one that will give you a sense of direction under surplus [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - i still draw benefit from the time i sat down about two years ago with a blank sheet of paper in front of me with the prompt “what are my values”, and have let every decision since then be guided by that
having a concrete list of things that you care about that you can refer back to can make certain paths suddenly obvious, and others clearly wrong or a waste a time.  [[Damian Stewart]]
    - I was quite pleased with what I came up with in response to this prompt

- Assuming that at least some >0 percentage of claims about tech company ignorance towards particular gendered issues (such as safety and privacy in social networks) are well-founded, does their persistence and repeated occurrence suggest more that a) companies are ignorant of the issues, or that b) companies are aware of the issues but do not care sufficiently to address them ?or i guess c) companies are aware and want to act but end up hiring grift and thus not getting the results they want [[Damian Stewart]]
    - my $.02, is potentially all of the above, but also that it's a legitimately hard problem. [[Darren Kong]]
    - i'd agree with @darren that this is a legitimately hard problem. in my admittedly limited experience (not sure how much of this generalizes): (1) REALLY solving it involves the creation of more diverse teams, and perhaps even more importantly, more diverse management. it takes time to hire people and promote people. often there are problems with the way people are selected for hiring, where recruitment focuses, team culture that can make certain folks feel less welcome and more inclined to leave, etc. (2) even when people do recognize the issues, they're often doing it after-the-fact (because these things weren't built-in from the beginning), so fixing them is a kind of technical debt. and nobody in management wants to deal with technical debt, because things "are good enough" right now and there's higher priority projects (new revenue streams, updated products, dealing with OTHER technical debt). (3) but a lot of the upper-upper management don't get it and/or don't care. so often times trying to fix things means figuring out how to route around the c-suite. and the cultural tone that's set exacerbates the other problem [[Nathan Acks]]
    - thanks for the thoughts - i guess the consultancy i'm thinking about would aim for trying to develop systematic thinking processes based on applying gender theory in productive ways, so that non-diverse teams becomes less of a problem
the ideal by-product would be managers who understand why diverse teams are important, which would just organically lead to more diverse teams over time; but the utopian idea i'm shooting for is that you can fix this problem with like one person in your org with enough authority to strategically push for things in ways that "simulate" having a diverse team(edited)
which i'm totally convinced - if every tech team hired a gender and/or critical race theory expert (not a "culture warrior" but someone who thoroughly understands the theory and what it means and what its limitations are) all sorts of gender and race problems in tech would disappear. a consistent pattern of amazement amongst the women-in-tech circles I follow on Twitter is how Twitter consistently fails to solve its nazi/asshole men problem, when the fix is blatantly obvious to anyone who understands how gender (in the gender-theory sense) and tech intersect - [[Damian Stewart]]
    - The conversations about diversity could be best structured via the lens of cognitive diversity in order to mitigate against the gender/race skewness that often occurs. Scott Page, a complexity science prof at Uni of Michigan wrote a great book about this called The Difference, where he showed how cognitively diverse teams are better at Complex Problem Solving and Prediction problems. He mathematically proved that {The Crowd's Square Error = The Mean Square Error - The Diversity of the Crowd} .... It therefore leads to rules on how to make Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) that can be used to channel diverse inputs to better problem solving -- something is very suited to the CoVid situation. I had given a 30 min talk about this a couple of years back and the video is on youtube. I also made a couple of simple slides that I'm sharing here. Hopefully they can be useful. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSZGvDQIdP7yTgyYALxz4LfLW9x6yXNo/view?usp=sharing - [[Kary]]
    - one thing I would be especially conscious of, in terms of [[positioning]] and sales but also the work itself, it that you should be solving your clients’ problems first and foremost, and using the toolbox in order to solve those problems. One doesn’t hire a guy with wrenches, one hires a plumber aka a guy who fixes pipes. So do be sure to have a problem-centric frame. Don’t sell me your grass seed, sell me my lawn [[David McDougall]]
    - +1 to David’s point. I’ve never successfully structured a gig around a tool or idea just because I wanted to apply it or thought they needed it. The only thing you sell is solutions to problems. Creating problems corresponding to tools (in the good sense) is a mob for books rather than gigs.[[Venkatesh Rao]]

- Hey all, how do you get your gigs/inquiry to gigs funnel? I know @Venkatesh Rao (US Pacific) has been very transparent, and mostly uses references and blog posts as incoming funnel. What about others? I am still on the job search/switch every year mode than gig mode, but every time i think about 'gigging this is what stops me. Any ideas/strategy blog posts? I don't have much of a pedigree or certificate. And I am in India, where gigging is still not happening and references are for jobs mostly - @nandhini
    - Think potential energy. Build up an asset and network over years. Don’t look for ways to generate leads from a cold start in weeks. What you do now might get you leads in 2021. Think leadgen with a min 12 month horizon - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - similar to what VGR mentions. At the core its kind of like a leap of faith. The more people that know youre working solo, the more people will funnel you people to talk with. For the first couple of years, I focused on writing about the meta-journey of going solo, sharing useful information via writing & proactively reaching out to orgs I wanted to work with (even pro bono sometimes). Similar to VGR again sometimes things take 12-18 months to even show up as a gig. I had someone I had 3-4 convos with in 2017 recently reach out with some actual real work. You need to find some mode that you like reaching out to people - whether its social media, writing, calling people, emailing them, etc. To be honest if you're still actively looking for jobs thats going to show up in how people think about working with you and how you commit to the journey. Gigging is going to be more about luck than not if you're not committing to at least an initial experiment of 12-18 months - [[Paul Millerd]]
