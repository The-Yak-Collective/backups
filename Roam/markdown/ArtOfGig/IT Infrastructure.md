# Assets
    - ^^This asset list is a work in progress, and is mostly based off of what [[Nathan Acks]] knows + SVG diagram development by [[Maier Fenster]]. If you work with or own a piece of infrastructure listed below, please visit the corresponding page and make sure all of the information's correct. And feel free to add services, etc. that we've missed!^^
    - [Roam diagrams](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/OB_uynVDM) are pretty limited; [[Maier Fenster]] has developed an SVG diagram that (currently) more completely captures the relationship between different components of the Yak Collective's IT infrastructure than is possible natively.
    - The symbols used in the infrastructure map have the following meanings:
        - {{[[table]]}}
            - **Symbol**
                - **Macro**
                    - **Meaning**
            - Double Green Circle
                - `STATIC_DATA`
                    - Website or service that functions as a (relatively) static data source/destination
            - Green Oval
                - `EXTERNAL_SERVICE`
                    - Externally-facing web service used by YC members/participants (and sometimes others)
            - Blue Oval
                - `INTERNAL_SERVICE`
                    - Internally-facing web service used by few YC members (sometimes not accessible at all)
            - Blue Rectangle
                - `APPLET`
                    - A function, service applet, or internal tool; contained by and run by some service
            - Red Line
                - `USER_DATA`
                    - Manual data flow (someone creates an account, reviews a list and takes action, etc.)
            - Black Line
                - `AUTO_DATA`
                    - Automatic data flows (service takes action based on a timer, webhook, etc.)
