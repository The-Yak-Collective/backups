- Zis is the Z1 prototype page, where the main focus is brainy & generic software for rovers. In scope:
    - Off-the-shelf hardware, and most likely other Yaks.
    - Software "brain" for rovers, configurable or automatically adaptable to the actual hardware.
    - Remote control, debugging, telemetry/monitoring.
    - [[Maier Fenster]] i think it will need more sophisticated gaits
- Naming: WIP
- **Key information**
    - Video stream and snapshot API available. Please ask Eric; access contained to really interested people at first, as the API server is very weak for now.
    - Bot text stream
        - Twitter (temporary) @YakRover
        - Discord: @IamZ1
    - Execution environment: Raspbian Buster
- Current Activity
    - Hardware: HiWonder SpiderPi
    - Images: https://postimg.cc/gallery/FQZ0cgT
    - Measurements for reference (WIP)
        - Metrics on "force": Apparently powerful servos (20Kg/cm2). Measurements t understand what that translates to in terms of lift, power on each leg relative to others, etc.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i would ask - can it climb a rock or tree by hugging it?
        - Generic metrics like speed, etc.
        - Temperature mapping using sensors and the Pi internal data: Useful when considering building water-proof clothing, etc.
        - Linear speed, turn speed.
    - Possible features
        - RT video stream from the camera (and other sensors?)
        - ability to select or upload (via github?) a code to be executed by robot and view the effect in RT, including video and servo positions
for now, i am thinking re delegate, that you have code on the robot and code on the server. one or both may need help. for video, why not stream using twilio?
    - Hardware alternatives
        - From Sascha: Roomba gang and mux for cheap radiation resistance.
            - Benefit of possible scavenging when fleet of rovers.
            - About testing a design: "Depends on what environment we're trying to simulate/test exactly. Xrays are cheap and easy to come by all over the place. For gamma there's Co-60 sterilization facilities. And then for a proton source there is renting time on a proton therapy machine."

        - Presentation of this rover build targets.
            - A rover build later in the year.
            - First, reflection and creation of a software package for rovers.
                - Intent is to find how to best interface low-level bot capabilities (be it a bogie or a spider) to high-level algorithms for "rovering", mapping, tracking, etc.
                - Concretely an operating system, provisional name BOS.
            - Idea of a DSL.
                - Anuraj suggests Xtext to design DSL.

        - Link to "sharing"
            - Original idea was just to share usage of remote bots, as they are expensive, and there is much to do on software.
            - Maier's suggestions to push on broader sharing as deepening of the idea {TODO add link to contents}

        - A SpiderPi is online, yet through SSH and manual work for now. The battery problem remains, but I have found a simple solution by tracking custom system services and turning them off. Now a "minimal" stack, with just what is needed to run the code. And just this allowed completing system updates without depleting the battery.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] can you share what services to stop? do you have a shell command for it?
            - This is "deprecated" issue, since we have a new power approach (yet still problems :-D)
            - The two main services stopped were `pigpiod` and `mjpg_streamer`, based on their apparent load (using `top`).
        - As for @Maier (U+2)#6756 suggestion turning off the servos, that did not work. After some search, I found the standard document linked above is superseded by one for the bot series (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b3v81sb9nwir16q/AACkK-tg0q39fKJZcSl-YrqOa/LX-16A%20Bus%20Servo?dl=0&preview=LewanSoul+Bus+Servo+Communication+Protocol.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1), and the command to turn off servos succeed by does nothing apparently. Code available if someone is interested.
        - The battery problem remains and may kill the bot for a reboot anytime if "pushed too much". For now trying to push toward the intended goal to remote control/remote install code, while looking a ways to deal with battery (i.e. learning the platform).

        - Idea from Maier: Power the Pi from USB-C, and servos through the controller (the provided power via battery).
            - No luck. The Pi 4 is not new and probably hitting https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-4-usb-c-update . I have 4 cables from different makers around, each one of them "cheap" and yet e-marked. I guess that is why the Pi does not charge. Internet tells me it is not easy to know which Pi 4 model is fixed, so better to assume it is not (the bot are about 1 year old).
            - Walked part of the "action group" route: The code comes with action groups as SQLite files. These files are basically servo settings records, with each record a set of value for each of the 18 servos. Some of the groups have 1 record, some a few dozens.
                - The code uses action groups only in LeServer, which I disabled, so it does not run anymore.
                - The servo controller stores some values, as it runs always the same dance on startup (toward a spider like pose). I did not fine how to access them yet. The servo controller documentation is lacking, as much as my knowledge.
                - Contacted HiWonder to get some pointers: Reply says action groups are reserved by HiWonder, although we can access them.
        - Found mjpg_streamer service consuming quite some CPU, even idle. Disabled to save current, but still not enough.
        - Another idea from Maier: Physically unplug servos.
            - Servos connected in 3 series. Unplugged 2 series (4 legs) to see how it holds.
            - Unplugging 1 series (2 legs) did not change depletion.
        - Started trying Twitch as an alternative to Twilio, but after too much time discovered it also requires a mobile phone number to create a video stream.

        - Direct power supply, with a quite good quality 36W block.
            - The system stays up without problem, even with a continuous video stream.
            - The system collapses when using the servos "too much" (which ranges from a few seconds to several seconds). Apparently the servos draw beyond 36W.
        - Video stream using `mjpg_streamer`
            - It works just fine. A public IP is available to see the stream and take snapshots.
            - I (Eric) do not publish it here, as the server is very weak, and we would like to reserve it for actual project members for now. Please get in touch if interested! Inclusive here.
            - Left Twilio and co for now, as distracting from the mission. Integration is still relevant to save resources on the bot, as well as delegating heaps of issues like networking and quality tuning.
