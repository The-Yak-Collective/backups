    - @Ken's cautions are worth noting, so I suggest we take an experimental approach to this and start with 2 city level channels and see how things go before letting city channels proliferate. I am personally fine with sacrificing a little (even a lot) of participation, since participation for the sake of participation isn't the purpose of this network. We're solving for productive collaborations, small teams going after gigs, and driving business/gigs for all of us. As far as I am concerned, this is primarily a community of doers trying to help each other build better indie businesses/careers, and collaborate better in doing more ambitious things. Anything that helps that is good. Anything that gets in the way of that should be cut out. Anything that's neither can be sacrificed or allowed to persist as a spandrel if it does no harm.
