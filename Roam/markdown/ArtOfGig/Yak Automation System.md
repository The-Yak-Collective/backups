# What is the Yak Automation System (YAS)?
    - This page is intended to collect notes as we build out a generalized "Yak Automation System" (YAS?).
    - The point of this system is to come up with a English-like domain-specific language that we can use to describe proposals **and** to build out an automation system based on this language.
        - This language will not only be used to implement a direct automation system, but also a "Yak dreamspace" where half-considered "wouldn't it be cool if..." proposals can be written down and then synthesized by GPT-3 or some similar system into unique new proposals that could be presented to the collective.
    - When possible, the YAS should be able to automatically implement these proposals once they reach some consensus threshold.
        - The first YAS automation will __probably__ be [channel lifecycle automation]([[Discord Channel Lifecycle and Organization]]).
    - The first step in this process is to create [a list of past proposals/decisions](((b-1y0K2DN))) so we can figure out what what structure this language will need.
# 2021 Proposals/Decisions
    - 
# Other Things We'd Want the Robot to Understand
    - Event automation #[[Jenna Dixon]]
        - on-Discord event setup
        - on-Discord Announcement channel reminder sequence
        - yaktweet bot reminder sequence, optional
            - some groups might want to stay on server only eg OGS? v Yak Rover 
        - prolly other bits
