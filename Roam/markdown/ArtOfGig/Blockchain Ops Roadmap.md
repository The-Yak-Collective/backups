    - Jan 3: Planning 
        - Day/Time
            - Seems to work for most people, unless there are severe conflicts later we will keep this. 
        - Relation to other tracks
            - Primarily tactical/practical application of decentralization
            - Fridays are doctrine (high level principles)
            - Mondays are blockchain specific strategy
            - Wednesdays are turning Blockchain + others into practical implementation plans. 
            - Saturdays are a working implementation session. 
        - Roadmap prioritization
            - DAOification
                - Tokenomics, emerging properties of tokens. 
                - Case studies, how are things emerging there? 
                - Automation at the center. How do we automate out the mechanisms so the automation is at the center? 
            - Web3 publishing infrastructure
            - NFTs
            - Finance aspects
            - Learning the tech: Solidity programming, etc.
                - Prioritize this by doing (Dogfooding)
                - Blockchain implementations and different smart contract implementations
                - How are security concerns handled? DAO attack vectors
            - Decentralized Identity
            - Idenity
                - Reputatiom/clout
            - Cloud identity.
                - Reputation Clout
                - What is the right way to create flexible on-chain identities? 
            - Community provenance
            - Community provenance
            - Cultural component of DAOification
            - Agreements -> Rules (D of DAO). 
                - How does this turn into community participation? 
            - DAO abstraction
                - Currently, DAOs try to build everything. How do they evolve to be symbiotic? 
            - Next steps: 
                - VGR will consolidate the above list to 5-7 items and bucketize everything. 
                    - As we talk about them, we will add checkmarks to the bucket. 
                - **Everyone**: Take dates off of the roadmap list (to research topics and present out)

    - Jan 10: DAOs comparison paper
        - Prompt Article - https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13174-021-00139-6
            - Question - Prompt: Call out what key points jumped out at you, and what you think the most important design variables are for a DAO
        - Discussion
            - [[Anuraj R]] - Gas Prices, Do humans override blockchain
            - [[Bryan King]] - 
            - [[Commits Vortex]] - 
                - Development of Aragon ie 3 branch governance model, creating buffers of voting disputes, the proposal acceptance is not automatic, ability of someone to dissent
                - How important is to have voting mechanism on chain
            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - Difference in system based on proposals vs systems based on tasks, task-based appears simple
                - Vote systems - majority and threshold based
                - The paper does not seem exhaustive, maybe voting is not the best way to make decisions
                - Graph of the activity of the DAOs
            - [[Jenna Dixon]] - 
                - appreciate the chance to feel the size and breadth
                - wonder how many of the communities are going after something we would call real
                - wonder if a consesus is being reached on the minimum viable size of a community
                - appreciated the explanation of Conviction Voting, would like see it in action, since it addresses the intermittant attention that we see in YakC and is prolly common in DAOs where participatnts and part-time
                - proposal-driven schema vs task-driven distinction seems like a big deal, maybe Venkat can say a bit of how/why Colony went that route
            - [[Kiran Pathakota]]
                - Super low activity numbers for Aragon
                - Voting systems feed into design variables, we want high velocity decision system and also friction based decision system
                - Incentives, for some decisions, specific people are needed, what goes into blockchain
            - [[Maier Fenster]]
                - What is YakC solving for and what are other DAOs 
                    - They seem to solve of bad actors and trust
                    - YakC seems to solve for goodness 
                - The other problem we want to solve for is "how to increase activity"? Project bounty gives some activity but maybe not the best incentive
                - Would interesting to solve for motivation without using money? What would make YakC interesting and pleasant
            - [[Patrick Atwater]]
                - Is is possible to have an "amend the blockchain"? that was missing
                - In terms of YakC, what are we solving for, for others many solve for money, "What is the Tao of YakC"
            - [[Rafael Fernandez]]
                - Good overview of all the voting mechanism in DAOs
                - This is the first generation of tooling, seem to going for enterprise solution, design space around decisions, what are you solving for is not fully explored
                - Do these tools make sense ? Mirror has not chosen any specific tooling. That does not exclude decentralizzed decisions
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - Little premature to write an article, TheDAO - 50M stolen, ThaDAO for VC, and Ethereum was young enough to hard fork - the garden of Eden story of DAO
                - Do you truly want to go fully automated? Or have reversal mechanism? 
                - Initial focus on financial management, not on governance of others
                - Whether to use a platform or roll out your own 
                - Can you have not so legible mechanisms in decision, reputation affects voting in other areas, legible vs illegible
                - Can we design a DAO to motivate a full range of behaviour, can we really make it so that we could trade it outside DAO
            - Discord voice-meta Discussion start - https://discordapp.com/channels/692111190851059762/698566364595486720/930126176482119810
            - Open Floor
                - [[Rafael Fernandez]] - Composability and Fragmentation of Tooling
                    - Two schools Full Enterprise Solution vs Plugin/Composibility(might win) Type Ecosystem
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]] - In IT infrastructure - Microsoft shops use the whole MS stack other use a mix and match approach. Smaller startups have more flexibility, both might emerge, but due to the nature of the medium the Plugin/Composibility types might win
                    - [[Rafael Fernandez]] - Lot of the execution might happen at sub DAO level or inter DAO level
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] - Data portability is a big concern while considering composability. Every thing on chain then standards on data might allow for flexibility
                    - [[Commits Vortex]] - When we talk of composability, is each block a smart contract? Smart Contract A and Smart Contract B and be able to call from other Smart Contract? 
                        - [[Rafael Fernandez]] - One is to be able to stack them together, eg a safe/vault can release from voting software, and the second is interoperability, voting within the pods in the DAO could be rolled up to make decision for the entire DAOs
                    - [[Commits Vortex]] - When you talk about chain agnosticism, how do contemporary DAOs think about the mutability of software that isn't on chain? (i know you can make proxy contracts for on-chain contracts, but complicated). Do contemporary DAOs see any problem with the mutability of off-chain legos in terms of both decentralization and long-term operability between the legos? Or is that not the right way of framing the question of off-chain composability?
                - [[Venkatesh Rao]] -
                    -  Roll ups are kind of like side chain mechanisms to minimize the number of transactions, something like batch processing, a design variable to play with.
                    - In the #infrastructure channel the fundamental activity is not the tokens etc but of logging. so all of the activity is generating data and in principle could be implemented on chain and other extreme is illegible logging which is happening right now in this meeting. We need to decide what to capture and how much. It is a data design decision. Seems like a place to start
                - [[Jenna Dixon]] - Do we want have these calls recorded and posted to YouTube? 
                    - seems to appear consensus - yes to recording - practice accountability and abandon [[Chatham House Rules]]
                    - [[Jenna Dixon]] will record next three sessions 
        - Outline of the DAO platform comparison paper, via [[Commits Vortex]]:
            - TheDAO
                - hacked
                - fork of eth
                - risk in contracts
                - formation of dao creation platforms
                    - Platforms
                        - Aragon
                            - apps (sets of smart contracts)
                                - Finance
                                - Token
                                - Agent
                                - Vote
                                    - 1) The majority required: From all cast votes, the percentage of positive cast votes must be greater than or equals to the required percentage of support. 
                                    - 2) The minimum participation required: The minimum acceptance quorum parameter states the minimum percentage of votes cast from all possible votes in the DAO.

                                    - Dandelion (derived from DAOhaus)
                                    - Dot-Vote
                                        - More options than yes/no binary
                                    - Conviction Voting
                                        - express preference
                                        - longer held, higher conviction
                                        - can change at any time
                                        - lowers conviction
                                        - can set conviction thresholds for vote to pass
                                    - Committee template
                                        - sub-groups within dao
                                        - see also optimistic dao structure
                        - DAOstack
                            - aims to tackle governance scalability problem
                            - problem with 51% voter turnout to pass
                            - lowering quarum to relative majority opens up attack vector of spamming proposals, and dilluting attention, resulting in more proposals (advisarial) being passed
                                - holographic cosensus
                                    - meant to solve this problem through middle layer prediction market
                                    - community members may “bet” if a certain proposal will pass or not pass, staking a certain amount of their tokens
                                    - if a proposal receives enough stakes, reaching a threshold, it may skip the requirement of absolute majority voting and be passed with a relative majority.
                                    - act as a filter for the community, which may focus on the proposals that attract attention from stakers.
                                    - stakers filter out bad proposals
                                    - thry do this through financial incentivisation based on rewards for being right or wrong in prediction
                        - DAOhuas
                            - mimic the behaviour of moloch dao
                            - non-quorum
                                - relative majority is always enough to pass
                            - rage-quit mech
                                - may exit dao with resources if not in agreement
                                    - exiting happens during graceperiod after approvl and before settlement
                                    - is around 30% exit, the proposal is rejected
                                    - fear of rage-quit makes communities prone to consensous
                            - two types of proposals
                                - calls to community action (allocation of shares)
                                - donations to dao (paying tributes)
                            - two versions v1 and v2
                                - in v2, dao members can be expelled
                                - non-dao members can submit proposals
                                - introduction of sponsorship
                                    - when proposal is sent, requires sponsorship
                                    - brings it up into voting queue
                                    - sponsor gets a portion of deposit back at end of voting regardless of outcome
                        - Colony (not discussed)
                            - DAOs are task-driven, which means tasks are published, and members accept them for a payout
                - network considerations
                    - xDai sidechain of eth
                    - fraction of gas to summon a proposal
                    - less decentralized than eth, and dependent on eth
                    - lower voting rate (not sure why)
    - Jan 17 — Venkat, [Discussion of Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)
        - Article - https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q
            - Prompt Q - any features that should be include in DAO design which you didn't think of before the article?  
        - Discussion
            - [[Anuraj R]]
                - Ruth Catlow, co-founder of Furtherfield and DECAL decentralized arts lab, notes, “We need to be building cultures before structures”
            - [[Commits Vortex]]
                - how people could push against norms, disintermediation between economics and governance rights
            - [[Grigori Milov]]
                - the idea of decoupling governance and economics
                - to use governance rights people need to have expertise, at the moment of crises democracy may not be the best way forward
                - "culture comes before structure"  - good to consider opposite view that one needs some structure as a basis for some culture. structure of incentives then it comes little earlier than culture, think incentives first
            - [[Maier Fenster]]
                - A DAO - why all this focus on money? DAO -  a bastard child of gaming?, view from the article
                - What design features - create DAO in our culture, some sort of tool that allows create, absorb culture quickly
            - [[Meredith Noelle]]
                - relation between economics and governance
                - how can we design a DAO differently? what does exactly "governance" mean? large part governance is resource management
                - quote by RAND corp - corps are for optimizing supply chain etc
                    - "Sensory functions are quite different from production functions, and require different modes of organization—e.g., more networks connected to the world outside an office’s boundaries. Determining appropriate designs for all manner of sensory organizations may become a good meta-theme for innovative research and development in the years ahead"
            - [[Rafael Fernandez]]
                - the article called into question - what does it actually mean to have these new types of toolkits? 
                - new forms of organization possible
                - gaming guilds, reputation accumulation
                - YakC cultural exploration, internet culture
                - changing boundaries of businesses - underated
            - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                - quote "most DAOs represent governance through tokesn ...." interesting point relating to [[Maier Fenster]] why do we want to bring in money in
                - money like principles into spaces that are not money related
                - interview of Alexis Ohanian and comment about games/token - https://discordapp.com/channels/692111190851059762/904793053598998618/932672125402222704
                    - others comment  
                - Ivan Illich newsletter, defends spaces which are not market oriented. the preservation of vernacular spaces defence by Illich
                - people who want to preserve vernacular/illegible see DAOs as threat
                - DAOs planning to burn all its token if temperature goes above some degrees 
                    - weird way to price in social costs
                - exit to community idea realization - theory of the community around the firm - theory of ecosystem
            - Open Floor
                - [[Rafael Fernandez]] - backward financiazation
                    - how many people are planning this don't have growth as the primary objective but have symbiotic and ecosystem harmony as primary objective
                    - create sustainable spaces of exploration
                - [[Commits Vortex]]
                    - trojan horsing into finance, how would it work? if systems are autonomous the capacity to enter into and influence seems different, 
                    - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
                        - whats the closest analogy - shareholder activism, started in the 80s, proxy-wars, corporate raider subcultures to change direction of business, since coroporate doesn't have automated decision making, so corporate has concept of inside people and outside raiders
                        - what DAOs is different - there are no insiders if the core is autonomous enough, for YakC people who joined earlier have become insiders, but this could be different if the core is automated enough
                        - taking over can occur in a deeper way compared to corporates
                    - soft culture, [[Grigori Milov]]'s comment about democratic voting useful in certain contexts, 
                    - twitch plays pokemon phenomenon, play by chat, in the beginning there was complete anarchy, temporary voting for control, the game oscillated between anarchy and democracy
                    - which modality of governance is useful in what contexts
                    - parameterize the contract so that governance could move between quadrants
                -  [[Rafael Fernandez]]
                    - a lot of DAOs seems to have similar feeling of anarchy and democracy
                    - when a DAO oscillates between democray and anarchy, does DAO compete with corporations? what corporation would compete with pokemon like DAO? 
                    - [[Commits Vortex]]
                        - there might be modalities in what corporates want to do
                    - [[Rafael Fernandez]]
                        - some concepts from corporates might not apply to DAOs
                    - [[Meredith Noelle]]
                        - historical accidence of corporates and the accident of DAOs?

                        - what is reality in the DAO landscape in cultural terms

                                - corporates and countries have different cultures

                - [[Maier Fenster]] from discord
                    - fancy 1:  This led to the idea that organizational values could be automated and executed by code, a lingering idea that perhaps falsely suggests tacit knowledge can be fully expressed in a software protocol
                    - fancy 2:  In part, this is because not all stakeholders have the purchasing power representative of their stake, and their practical knowledge may be excluded from governance. This should be solved by shifting the culture toward more decision making mechanisms that decouple economic interest from governance rights.
                    - fancy 3:  Stakeholders with practical knowledge, or “tacit” knowledge, like land stewards in the case of Regen Network, benefit governance by incorporating informal practices in decision making.
                    - [19:02]
                    - fancy 4:  the expectation of transparent co-ownership of its assets from the start
                    - fancy 5:  In practice, this feature to distribute shares was rarely used because it did not enhance existing cultural patterns.
                    - fancy 6:  a quote of a quote, actually: Much of the literature about redesigning organizations for the information-age focuses on production—on improving productivity, or manufacturing something new like the Boeing 777 jetliner. Yet, does this not reflect a lingering industrial-age mentality? Production organizations remain a crucial part of the organizational ecology. However, we should also be thinking about “sensory organizations.” Sensory functions are quite different from production functions, and require different modes of organization—e.g., more networks connected to the world outside an office’s boundaries. Determining appropriate designs for all manner of sensory organizations may become a good meta-theme for innovative research and development in the years ahead (27).
    - Jan 24 - [[Kiran Pathakota]] - [[Solana Ecosystem]] Options
        - [[Anuraj R]] 
            - What is the difference between solana and eth? 
            - Why is solana cheaper?
        - [[Commits Vortex]]
            - Solana is a peek into the future of ethereum. 
            - Network was degraded over the weekend (12 hour outage)
                - Inundation of bots spamming the network
                - https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21883
            - Contrast with generative art market on tezos, [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/articles/beta), only open 12 hours at a time. Weird for an online commerce site having "hours of use". 
            - [Nina](https://nina.market/). 
                - Exploratory phase, seeing what's around. 
                - What would YC want to do? 
                    - Make a DAO? 
                    - Make a protocol? 
                    - Use a dApp for distribution? 
        - [[Kiran Pathakota]]
            - What would it look like for one of these protocols to focus on the ledger side of things rather than the currency
            - The focus doesn't seem to be primarily focused on $SOL
            - Since minting tokens on Solana is low friction, there is a different texture of activity on Solana
            - One thing we could do as a simple experiment:
                - Take a past project and mint it as an NFT
            - Would be really easy to mint a YC token
            - 
        - [[Maier Fenster]]
            - i simply got lost and i wonder what kind of map would prevent that.
        - [[Nathan Acks]]
            - DEXs have moved but there's not a lot of support for SNS. 
                - Doing a swap would need two smart contracts (one on each chain). How do we handle the gas fees? 
            - What's driving the cultural differences between Solana and Eth/Bitcoin? 
                - VC funding? 
                - lots of developer interest but the money still seems to be in Eth 
            - The question of Identity management is really interesting
                - Maybe a space for this in Solana
                - What do folks think about https://democracy.earth/ ? - PA
            - A lot of the links shared on Solana, and other blockchains, really lean into the financial aspect of ledgers, rather than more purely on just distributed ledger technology
            - 
        - [[Patrick Atwater]] 
            - Solana has raised $340M. How do main folks make money back? 
            - what on earth is a liquidator in the solana solend defi?
                - DAI might work like this. DAI is over-collaterized (put 150% eth in to withdraw 100% of DAI). If it fell below the threshold, vault would be liquidated, all the eth equivalent to the DAI, it would be sold at the auction. This is how it works in MakerDAO.

            -  A lot of this is similar to escrow
                - Or employer provided insurance and being part of a larger pool negotiating insurance coverage
            - Are the L2 scaling solutions reducing autonomy and producing formal institutions?
        - [[Commits Vortex]]
            - Layer 2 saturations
            - Is there an inherent way the network tends towards congestion?
        - [[Maier Fenster]]
            - Feeling cheated when reading about L2
            - Promised a distributed network that would change the world
            - The promise of 10-100x improvement might not be a lot
            - The ability to dispute fraud seems against the ethos of the initial ideology
            - What to do in contexts where humans and the need to execute quickly are in place?
                - This could be especially important in the context of L2
        - [[Nathan Acks]]
            - Came away from the reading with two questions about rollup types
                - Optimistic roll ups
                    - Fraud challenge mechs
                        - Somewhat undefined
                        - Spot challenge might not be idea in terms of motivated watchers, and rather better to be randomized
                - Zero knowledge (ZK) proof roll up 
                    - Seems like the better solution, but being handled with an even hand to Optimistic roll ups in the ethereum.org writeup
            - Identity and Wallets
                - If wallet type technologies were how we came to handle identities, that would be a huge improvement in terms of being able to mix and match and create identity
                - Parallels with Gemini protocol
                - There is a general bubbling up of solutions to this particular issue of identity
            - For all the narrative of speed, there seems to be more of a move towards deliberative transactions
                - Pace dissonance
            - Scaling trilemma
        - [[Patrick Atwater]]
            - Had a friend developing on Stacks Chain. Similar to L2 for Bitcoin
            - The way Ethereum was doing roll ups made it more difficult to audit data in the rollups
        - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
            - Try a sidechain
            - Try the gnosis chain
            - Switch to that chain
            - Jeavons Paradox
                - Demand isn't solved
                - But this is actually good, in a progressive sense
                    - More people frustrated is better than less people frustrated
            - Braess' Paradox
                - Releasing congestion for traffic
                - Mathematical topological form of Jeavons Paradox
            - The pattern of promise v. reality
                - When you hit the scaling problems you go back to a more pragmatic stance
                - In web3 -- even in the Satoshi whitepaper, there is a hint of utopianism
                - But when you go look at the technology, even though it has increased the level of decentralization, there still looks like there is still too much centralization, and this is spun into a moral failure
                - This was the pattern in the Moxie web3 article
                - Authentication is one example where decentralization has actually been relatively well implemented
                - > "The job of the science fiction author is not to predict the automobile, but to predict the traffic jam"
                - Metaphors for scalling
                    - Side chains are like Side Service Lanes
                    - L2 rollups are like HOV (High occupancy vehicles) Lanes
                    - L1s are the Highway
                - The highway metaphor is comparable to the potentially idealistic nature of automobile ideas when they were first produced
            - When we say that the blockchain is fast, we are making a comparison to centralized bureaucratic settlement
                - With a DAO smart contract
                - It might take a very short amount of time
                - But when we start to work with computers, we think of latency in a different scale
                - The comparison between human and computers is different

- ## Bootstrapping Agenda Topics suggest by Rafa
    - **Lore / Mission / Story** (I think your recent writing on fiction / sci-fi is particularly helpful here, as well as Impro)
    - **Ethics, Governance Process** (probably need to start thinking about democracy, representation, delegation, and power dynamics. These then are translated into actual operational components like quadratic voting)
    - **Treasury Management** (this includes thinking about digital assets like fungible tokens vs. NFT club passes, how they are distributed, who holds them, what liquidity should be available, transferability, utility (voting, access, economic reward)) -- initialized, see [[YC Treasury]]
    - **Membership and Participation** (this is related to the "who" and what types of contribution zones we want to reinforce / support / nudge)
    - ![](./images/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uZGlzY29yZGFwcC5jb20vYXR0YWNobWVudHMvOTA0NzkzMDUzNTk4OTk4NjE4LzkwNjYwMTg2MjgwMTc4NDg0Mi9GRGJHTWUyWG9Bd2hxX2oucG5n)
- ## Currently proposed experiments
    - A multi-sig wallet with n/m signature authority to hold and disburse YC funds in the form of ethereum or a suitable stablecoin (tbd)
    - Publish the [[Governance Readings Six Pager]] on [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) as a split-contract NFT with proceeds being divided suitably among contributors and a YC fund.
    - [[Rovers and Blockchain]]
        - Put wallets on rovers  of the [[Yak Rover]] project and have them run a collaboration economy on tokens
