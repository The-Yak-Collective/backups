    - ML and Robotics
    - Component ML vs. 
    - Universal controller problem
        - Optimal control
            - Adaptive control
            - Robot control
            - Universal stablising control
            - Internal model principle
                - Switching approach to many conditions, but no stability guarantee
        - In AI, search for a piece of software that can control any robotic body
        - "Can operate seamlessly in any kind of environment, any object"
    - "Auto RT"
    - LLM, LMM and others look universal as they deal with an underlying notion of sequence, with some temporality.
    - "Toward General Purpose..." robotics survey.
    - Discussion on optimal control vs. LMM based approaches
        - OC has careful model of the robot I/O and environment.
        - LMM "encodes" aspects of the environment via training.
        - An LMM trained on Earth would likely me more capable in an unknown environment like Mars, but still be lacking knowledge of the environment. E.g. skidding on regolith, unavailable on Earth.

    - Multi "brain" MCU - CPU -GPU, ec
        - When would the ML brain be used?
        - Use cases
        - Role allocation
        - E.g. of the man who mistakes his wife for a hat: Brain section damage
        - Failure modes
    - Board option we discuss little is the Coral: https://coral.ai/products/#prototyping-products
    - Role allocation
        - Oak-D
        - Jetson run LLM fed from Oak-D and other sensors
    - Capabilities of Oak-D
        - Can run different software, including object segmentation and classification.

        - GPT-4 can interpret basic data series data. And it can predict what happens or what to do. It can also generate data "plans", roughly convincing. and impressive.
        - Can also (try to) generate graphical representation of he data.![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FnVtbM1Y96x.png?alt=media&token=e55600c3-547d-48f3-8bbc-edf9b8b94f9f)
