    - ML and Robotics
    - Component ML vs. 
    - Universal controller problem
        - Optimal control
            - Adaptive control
            - Robot control
            - Universal stablising control
            - Internal model principle
                - Switching approach to many conditions, but no stability guarantee
        - In AI, search for a piece of software that can control any robotic body
        - "Can operate seamlessly in any kind of environment, any object"
    - "Auto RT"
    - LLM, LMM and others look universal as they deal with an underlying notion of sequence, with some temporality.
    - "Toward General Purpose..." robotics survey.
    - Discussion on optimal control vs. LMM based approaches
        - OC has careful model of the robot I/O and environment.
        - LMM "encodes" aspects of the environment via training.
        - An LMM trained on Earth would likely me more capable in an unknown environment like Mars, but still be lacking knowledge of the environment. E.g. skidding on regolith, unavailable on Earth.
