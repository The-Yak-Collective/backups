- ## Describe this world
    - 'Fly me to the moon' - A reality show following a group of wealthy, older Americans leaving Earth to take up residence in space and escape the pandemic ended 8 years ago after a single season. There was a lot of advertising, a nation-wide talent search, a training facility set up at Disney World's Space Mountain, and then their parent company declared bankruptcy. It was hard to care too much about some old people you didn't know, when the iRemember was available. Able to record all your thoughts and memories, people became more interested in their own and other people's pasts. With advances in AI algorithms, the recorded past could even be used as training data to generate personalized stories in your own preferred forms. Want to relive your adolescence in the Arkansas Bible Belt as a lost sequel to the Indiana Jones series? The iRemember can help.

        - In a [[transformation]] future [[a few years]] from now, there is an [[show]] related to [[the moon]] that creates a feeling of [[outrage]].  'Fly me to the moon' - A reality show following a group of wealthy Americans leaving Earth to take up residence in space. Will life in space be safer than life with COVID? Tune in Thursday to find out
    - [[Fragment 035: iRemember]]
        - In a [[transformation]] future [[a generation]] from now, there is an [[instrument]] related to [[family]] that creates a feeling of [[anxiety]]. iRemember: Apple creates a device that records your thoughts and memories. Combined with your digital footprint (public and private), this instrument allows you and your family to remember everything about you, now and forever.
- ## What tensions, paradoxes, challenges exist in this world?
    - Tensions: The future as entertainment versus the past, the desire to live life privately and the incentive to live life more dramatically and capture it with iRemember in the hopes of a future television deal. Governments wanting access to the data.
    - Paradoxes: Being able to record all your thoughts and memories would seem to have much bigger implications outside of entertainment, but I think it has that regression to the mean quality that many innovations have. Kind of like how the internet puts all of civilization's knowledge at your fingertips, but many people just use it to send emails to their grand kids or share cat pictures.
    - Challenges: Large data storage requirements, privacy concerns over how and how much data is shared with others, seems like it might be desirable to hackers and bad actors who could use it for blackmail, but it could also change the justice system a lot. Easier to convict people if you can just download their memory of the event in question, although there's the 5th Amendment. I'm sure advertisers would want to stick ads in there somehow.
- ## What year is this scenario set in?
    - 2040
- ## How does it feel to live in this time?
    -  Politics is as contentious as ever. Politicians are either increasingly bland as they don't want anything recorded that could come back to bite them or they are increasingly wacky/shocking in an attempt to distinguish themselves 
    - Able to record all your thoughts and memories, people became more interested in their own and other people's pasts. Combined with sophisticated AI algorithms, the recorded past can even be used as an input to generate personalized stories in your own preferred forms. Want to relive your adolescence in the Arkansas Bible Belt as a lost sequel to the Indiana Jones series? The iRemember can help.
    - Communities and associations of people are organized around their decision whether or not to live with an iRemember. Some religious communities stay far away from it while others consider its rejection deeply reckless and or immoral. iRemember video feeds, in addition to their use as entertainment, become indispensable to solving certain crimes, and you may be seen as a terrible parent if, for instance, your child is abducted or hurt and you did not bother to equip him with an iRemember device. You may be seen as "getting what you had coming to you" if you are robbed or a crime is committed against you, and you couldn't be bothered to turn your iRemember on. Certain jobs may now require submissions of iRemember recordings as a condition of employment.
- ## Who wins in this future? Who loses?
    - Winners:
        - People with exciting or novel lives.
        - AI-assisted content curation becomes a large industry.
        - Data storage firms and cloud providers
        - Researchers, prison psychologists, juries and the justice system, and any organization or profession where large quantities of data on individual's personal lives can be mined for meaningful answers
        - Families who never want to miss a moment of their child's lives.
        - Kids who are bullied (they have proof!)
        - Naval gazing novelists who enjoy mining their personal lives for characters.
    - Losers:
        - People who don't want every aspect of their lives recorded or who experienced some type of trauma they'd prefer to forget.
        - "The forgotten" who lived a large portion of their lives before the introduction of the iRemember and who are rarely believed about anything they say occurred in their past.
        - People who make strong claims or tell grandiose and hyperbolic stories about their personal lives.
        - Criminals
- ## How did we get from here to there?
    - As the pandemic continued to spread widely and effective vaccines were slower to arrive than anticipated, the entertainment industry underwent a profound transformation. In 2025, through a collaboration with Paramount, SpaceX, and Vice Media, a group of struggling millionaires, most of whom had inherited their wealth or won it in divorce proceedings and whose fortunes had begun to dwindle are recruited for the 'Fly me to the moon' television show. It lasts for several seasons, engaging the world but turned out to be the last hurrah for what was known as "reality television." Over the next several years, the entertainment industry further collapses but is saved with the iRemember. Touted by Apple as a way for families to remember anything and everything, content creators found in it a veritable gold-mine of potential material. And it could be produced on a budget because there were no egotistical actors or fickle writers to pay. "A day in the life of..." or "X phenomena through the eyes of..."-type series became ubiquitous and behavior began to change. It was an art imitating life imitating art infinite regress.
- ## How do people talk about the choices we made in 2020?
    - Kind of like the way we talk about 9/11 today. A certain reverence for the event itself, a kind of embarrassment at the course of events afterwards. It is nevertheless deeply meaningful for those who were alive on either side of it.

- ## What keeps you up at night?
    - Worries or excitement about what you will record or capture on your iRemember device.
    - Whether a story you told about yourself is actually true.
    - The possibility for data theft, hacking, fabrication or alteration of iRemember data.
