- # Creating scenarios
    - To set the scene for the speculative fiction to be produced through this project, we are bringing together different combinations of [[Sprint 1: Future Fragments]] and building on these to create juicy, more fully developed visions of different futures containing more nuanced overlays, tensions, and collisions between these fragments that the speculative fiction can explore and extrapolate. 
    - Begin by reviewing the fragments created in Sprint 1. You might review them in Roam through the [[Sprint 1: Future Fragments]] master list or by viewing the Graph Overview; alternatively you can view the Harman Fan on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kpEmVVk=/).
    - As you review these fragments, pay attention to any [[Pockets of the future in the present]] this reminds you of. Add details of these pockets to the info on the fragment’s Roam page, along with a supporting link (if available).
    - When you find some fragments that you think make a provocative combination (2 or more):
        - Share your thinking with the contributors who created the fragments to riff on the idea together
        - As it develops, put your thinking about this world into a scenario page (links below)
    - ## Methods for selecting fragments
        There is a plethora of ways to create combinations of fragments; we recommend experimenting with a few different approaches to find something that you find sticky. Some pathways in:
        **Create a sequence unfolding over time:** [String together fragments that occur in different time horizons](https://www.slideshare.net/wendyinfutures/future-of-universities-an-example-of-scenario-building-using-the-harman-fan). What kind of narrative follows the ebbs and flows of these particular fragments? What stories emerge from the spaces between these fragments?

        **Collisions at a point in time:** Bring together fragments predominantly within a single time horizon. What opposing forces are at play in this world? What dilemmas might you encounter living at this point in time? If set a way in the future, how might the people living in this time talk about the choices we made at this moment?
            - [[Time scales]]
        **Follow a common thread:** Bring together fragments created from a common prompt - be it an [[Arc]], a [[Terrain]], an [[Object]], or a [[Mood]]. How are these fragments interacting? What commonalities lie between them? How do they differ? What different world views & perspectives might be at play in this world?
        **Random selection:** Much like creating prompts in The Thing From The Future, sometimes the most interesting ideas come from seemingly unrelated groupings. Look for combinations that make you pause or see a possibility you hadn't realised before.
- # Master list: All scenarios
    - [[Scenario 01: Taking it slow with programmable tattoos]] 
    - [[Scenario 02: In A Class of Their Own ]]
    - [[Scenario 03: AR exposes our embarrassing moments ]]
    - [[Scenario 04: collectable diaspora]]
    - [[Scenario 05: iRemember and the future of entertainment]]
    - [[Scenario 06: THE MINISTRY OF RESTORATION ]]
    - [[Scenario 07:  We Don't Need No AR Homeschooling  ]]
    - [[Scenario 08: order of family work]]
    - [[Scenario 09: Quarantiny Homes]] 
        - 1- Orba G enjoys her domestic cozy life: Eating & Software is her world
        - 2- Her tele-doctor diagnoses her as depressed & disconsolate due to her lack of physical contact. She has particularly longed to physically interact with her tele-Tinder pal who has been only tantalizing pixels since they met.
        - 3- She rents a Quaranteeny Home for 2 weeks, partially paid through a pharmaceutical trial
        - 4- During her lockup, she’s signed up for several challenges / educational experiences:
        - a) Probiomic Cleanse: She leaves her skin un-soaped for the fortnight alone. Her natural skin biome blooms to reach an equilibrium that sustainably fights off many pathogens.
        - b) Master class or Meditation Practice in tandem with a [[focus-mate]]
        - c) To monetize her rental, she signs up for a drug trial, since she can verify her diet, sleep, and [[biometric]] data. Biometrics include history of temperature, VOx, HRV. Packets of her body odor are intermittently mailed for trained dogs to sniff for precursor signs of infection.
        - 5- Her [[clean chain]] validation transforms her into a [[Touchable]]. 
        - Upon completion, her Q-tiny home enables her to coalesce with a bigger bubble. She will travel by a hermetically sealed Tesla to The Playa to join with other Touchables, including a chance to interact with her Tele-tinder play pal. 
        - 6- She parties on the Playa of Earning Man barebacked like it’s 2019
        - The festival’s finale (when the Earning Man’s Bubble is ritually popped) leaves her haunted by anxiety about her privileged pleasure of running around. She recalls the miserable status of the [[Great Unwatched]]
        - 7- She returns to her own cocoon with a mission: To build an expanding [[Bubble]], that will include working class and disenfranchised people. She devotes energy to an urban neighborhood, crowd-funding 10K Quarantiny homes deployed to a patch in Brooklyn. Block by block, the inclusive [[Green Zone ]]expands. This eventually creates a [[Green Zone]] called Pre-Coronial Williamsburg
        - 8- The segregation of the [[Touchables]] from the [[Great Unwatched]] gives way to a world with Universal Basic Housing. Every individual is afforded basic, hygienic homes. Occupants can continuously certify as Yellow (low risk but not max). When the occupant needs to work inside an occasional bubble, the housing supports Green certification.
