    - [[Fragment 060: Groovy intergalactic drones]]
        - Intergalactic humanlike drones can now explore the expanses of space and time - they can go anywhere at nearly the speed of light. It's groovy. Implants are now released that allow humans, from the comforts of their home-pods, to control the drone and experience life as if they are the drone. Given the infinite expanse, it becomes difficult but not impossible to find someone else inhabiting a drone with their implant. When you do, its magic - a feeling of charm and perhaps even romance can come over you. What a thrill.
- ## Describe this world
    - The launching of a thousand-million ships created a marketplace for the ones that were most interesting. 
    - It is like an intergalactic lottery and you never know what you are going to get: super boring empty space, super boring asteroids, somewhat boring stars with no planets, stars with planets in whatever is the cool [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements) of the day, super exciting planets with weird 'life.' 
    - Babies are bought a probe when they born as a keepsake. See [star registries](https://www.starregister.org/)).
    - There are even people that run pump and dump schemes for drones by getting probe-fluencers to consider particular galactic phenomena to be 'cool.' See [Magic: The Gathering markets](https://www.wired.com/story/the-stockbrokers-of-magic-the-gathering-play-for-keeps/).
    - Of course, this is all protected by a very, very secure, centralized database back on earth (because blockchain didn't really work out how everyone wanted).
- ## What tensions, paradoxes, challenges exist in this world?
    - Speculation markets are constantly rotating through different interests as we learn more about the universe. 
    - Tension between scientists wanting to learn about the universe and people hoarding the 'good' probes. 
    - Which probes are the 1% really looking at and caring about? How does this differ from everyone else? What is 'making ends meet' to see the universe?
    - What is left if we can explore the universe so easily? Do we start to gaze back at ourselves? Or just start to become good consumers going with the flow of the (mostly random) market?
