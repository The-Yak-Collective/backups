- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[growth]] future [[a generation]] from now, there is an [[festival]] related to [[gender]] that creates a feeling of [[melodrama]].
- Fragment:: 
    - "Historical" festival (analogous to our present day Renaissance Faires and perhaps Steampunk cosplayers) looking back, with irony and melodrama through roleplaying, costumes, and reenactments, to gender identity struggles of a generation ago, and celebrating the steady mainstream acceptance of the displacing of conventional gender norms hegemony (and the "gender wars" confrontations about this) since then.
