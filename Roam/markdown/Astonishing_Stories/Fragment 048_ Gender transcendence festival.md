- **Scenario: **
    - In a [[growth]] future [[a generation]] from now, there is a [[festival]] related to [[gender]] that creates a feeling of [[melodrama]].
- Fragment:: 
    - In a generation from now there is a new festival that pops ups on to the scene which only allows people  in that do not see themselves as having a gender. They see this as a new movement outside of the LGBTQ+ movement and will not even allow people who identify as non-binary in. Obviously this creates some friction between the too groups which is played out like a soap opera on social media.
