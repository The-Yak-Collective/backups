- In a [[growth]] future [[two generations]] from now, there is a [[pill]] related to [[learning]] that creates a feeling of [[optimism]].
- Post-Covid, biotech gains renewed interest and financial backing that begins to pay off a decade or two later. Mid-century nootropics are becoming very effective at improving memory and restfulness, and propelling some American, Chinese, and Indian pharmaceutical companies into the stratosphere. Norms are changing around even brain drugs that exist today. A breakthrough in 2049 regarding a drug eerily similar to nicotine appears to slow and reverse the effects of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain diseases, which has become a societal focus especially in  rapidly aging societies like Japan and Europe. Entrepreneurs, grad students, and other rule-breakers get their hands on it already on the very early suggestion that it cuts sleep requirements in half and vastly improves shortterm memory. Longitudinal studies, though, take time- the drug remains out of reach for most non-infirm people.

    - I was thinking about **Modafinil**, which is easy to get in India (according to someone who isn't me~)
    - Nicotine: a bit of flavor detail for storytelling... **nicotine (NOT tobacco) has some (somewhat mixed)evidence of protection against cognitive decline**, and in some nootropic circles has already been rescued as a study drug. Looking now, I actually can find studies suggesting an inverse relationship between nicotine and Alzheimers' Disease, but I didn't have the time to look that up at the time. Lucky swing!
