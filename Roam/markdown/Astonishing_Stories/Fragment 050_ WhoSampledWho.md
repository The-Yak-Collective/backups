- **Scenario:**
    - In a [[transformation]] future [[two generations]] from now, there is a [[game]] related to [[music]] that creates a feeling of [[pathos]].
- Fragment:: 
    - WhoSampled is a very old game. If you are unfamiliar with it, it is somewhat similar to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon skipping from one piece of music to another according to who included samples of what. Due to causality, the chain generally goes backward in time, until it grounds out in the earliest recorded music.
    - WhoSampledWho is an art project that lightly augments WhoSampled with audio and visual representation of the artists in question, and these stories often touch upon the fundamental transformations in society since the earliest recorded music, including in particular race and power, and some of the mechanisms that power has been wielded (including copyright, distribution, attribution).
    - Kids can be moved to tears understanding how their favorite artists reference Fortnight's music, how Fortnight stole from dancers, those how dancers danced to songs, how those songsÂ referenced-by-sampling other songs which were built out of gospel.
