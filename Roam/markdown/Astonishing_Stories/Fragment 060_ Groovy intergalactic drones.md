- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[growth]] future [[a century]] from now, there is a [[implant]] related to [[drones]] that creates a feeling of [[charm]].
- Fragment:: 
    - Intergalactic humanlike drones can now explore the expanses of space and time - they can go anywhere at nearly the speed of light. It's groovy. Implants are now released that allow humans, from the comforts of their home-pods, to control the drone and experience life as if they are the drone. Given the infinite expanse, it becomes difficult but not impossible to find someone else inhabiting a drone with their implant. When you do, its magic - a feeling of charm and perhaps even romance can come over you. What a thrill.
