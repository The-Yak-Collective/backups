- @alexdw5#7827 @vgr#6648 I am actually fascinated with a modern state of branding. 
- I think if you already have a brand (like Amazon, or Xerox, or BCG) there is little you can do, except maintenance.
- But if you just getting started, it would be advisable to think from the very first principles.
- It is nice to know what Amazon was in 2001, but now it is "Everything Store with AWS". 
- Think about positioning. It sells everything, competes with everybody, is also a marketplace and has AWS, that everybody uses. 
- Boston Consulting Group has very little to do with Boston, but includes Digital Ventures, Gamma, Platinion, Omnia, BrightHouse, Expand, Inverto, Turn, etc. One can have hard time making sense of what BCG actually means or doesn't mean right now. 
- McKinsey said that 50% of it's business didn't exist 5 years ago, or something along those lines. And everything will change again in 3 years or so.
- Bain has Vector.
- Neither of them fits any template anymore.
- So what do you want a brand to do for you?
