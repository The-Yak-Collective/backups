- If you'd like to try hosting a chat, start a conversation in the Discord to recruit some initial interested members and then claim a suitable time/day slot to kick it off. Ask [[Yak Discord server]] admin to add your chat to the calendar. Check out this page of [[Chat Formats]] for ideas on useful structured formats, and to add your own. We follow [the Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) for these chats.
