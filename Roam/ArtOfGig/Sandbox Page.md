        - Copy the block ref of that summary paragraph

            - Indented under your name on this page, start typing 
              ```clojure
              {{embed: (())}}
              ``` and then paste your block ref. It should end up looking something like this: 
              ```clojure
              {{embed: ((((sOudXb4qS))))}}
              ```This will embed that summary paragraph and anything else under it here on this page. You can then edit it in either place.
