    - **Universal controller problem**

            - Adaptive control
            - Robot control
            - Universal stablising control
            - Internal model principle
                - Switching approach to many conditions, but no stability guarantee
        - In AI, search for a piece of software that can control any robotic body
        - "Can operate seamlessly in any kind of environment, any object"
    - "Auto RT"
    - LLM, LMM and others look universal as they deal with an underlying notion of sequence, with some temporality.
    - "Toward General Purpose..." robotics survey.
    - Discussion on optimal control vs. LMM based approaches
        - OC has careful model of the robot I/O and environment.
        - LMM "encodes" aspects of the environment via training.
        - An LMM trained on Earth would likely me more capable in an unknown environment like Mars, but still be lacking knowledge of the environment. E.g. skidding on regolith, unavailable on Earth.

        - When would the ML brain be used?
        - Use cases
        - Role allocation
        - E.g. of the man who mistakes his wife for a hat: Brain section damage
        - Failure modes
    - Board option we discuss little is the Coral: https://coral.ai/products/#prototyping-products
    - Role allocation
        - Oak-D
        - Jetson run LLM fed from Oak-D and other sensors
    - Capabilities of Oak-D
        - Can run different software, including object segmentation and classification.

        - GPT-4 can interpret basic data series data. And it can predict what happens or what to do. It can also generate data "plans", roughly convincing. and impressive.
        - Can also (try to) generate graphical representation of he data.![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FnVtbM1Y96x.png?alt=media&token=e55600c3-547d-48f3-8bbc-edf9b8b94f9f)

    - LLMs as a popular explanatory interface for low-code/no-code entrypoint
    - Extend discussion about multi-compute architectures
        - RaspberryPi (+GPU-like compute extensions) and Jetson Nano
    - Config options
        - Jetson Orin as whole brain
        - RPi5 + PCIe --> Hat with M.2 connector --> Accelerator like Coral
        - OrangePi (RaspberryPi alternative) can be smaller alternative as M.2 connector right on the board (no need for a hat)
        - [Axelera](https://www.axelera.ai/) alternative ML board
            - Has its own Voyager SDK

        - Which complete vertical stack (for getting to low-code, e.g. TVM compiler)
        - Which hardware config? Jetson Orin, Coral, Axelera, FPGA directly (Amaranth language LLKs talking to pytorch and below)
        - RISCV -- BeagleV Fire 
        - Power budget for ML
        - Low-code vs. high-code
        - Robust long-term vs. easy start
    - Constraint/bounding box
        - M.2 connectors are limited supply
        - 4G comms needs M.2, so does AI accelerator
        - Size (has to be no larger than RPi or Jetson)
        - Cooling/thermal considerations (fan etc)
        - Connections through i2c (other sensors) and SPI (camera)
        - Motor control

    - Are we too slow? Are we too late?
        - What about using new stuff every week? Why not focusing and build up?
        - Depends on style and stability of technology.
        - Questions become
            - What is worth doing?
            - What are the stable breakthroughs?
    - Discussions and readings:
        - Phases: Build each, build common, common platform like Tumblr, Yakasaur, LLM/crypto "only" or mainly.

    - PCB design: Anuraj's dual Nano new board
        - Two designs: Components and layout.
        - Components are the different electronics.
        - Layout is how the components are arranged physically.
        - Done with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), OSS. Tried with Flux, but confusing and knew KiCad from earlier experienc.
        - JLCPCB to manufacture. Faster if they have all required components sourced
        - Use KiCad's catalogue, or snapmedia.com to find parts' footprints to put on the layout.
        - ~55€ for manufacture and components (only ~4€ for PCB, way more expensive in, say, a German manufacturer)
        - Actual PCB production is usually well automated. E.g. of PCBWay assembly manufacturing machine video on YouTube.
        - KiCad has built-in validation (optional, so no validation by default and can be creating useless PCB), and there are there OSS for simulation, et

        - Trial but connections too close.
        - Errors have mysterious ways, problems with too many parts.
        - Lines may be too close to each other.
        - Too many Y shapes?
        - Comments from pros:
            - Avoid 90º, rather use 45º for physical reasons. https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/226582/pcb-90-degree-angles and https://www.signalintegrityjournal.com/articles/2104-should-you-worry-about-90-degree-bends-in-circuit-board-traces
            - Problem with filling space with ground https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/680791/should-i-fill-free-pcb-space-with-ground
    - Anuraj's work
        - Made boards received
        - Did not work with Arduino connected.
        - Problem was tests were done with old code, no properly recompiled.
        - Debugging
            - Found a problem of reset current, by measuring.
            - A pin was receiving a square signal (duty cycle), while it should not have.
            - Allowed to find a design problem, with capacity cycle (charge/discharge)
            - Problem is that 2 different reset pins get connected (reset pushbutton on Arduino schematics)
        - Solution
            - Found the 2 lines connecting the reset pins
            - Cut them physically
            - One horizontal on the left, and a diagonal one between the two main chips on the board.
            - After cut, works as expected.
