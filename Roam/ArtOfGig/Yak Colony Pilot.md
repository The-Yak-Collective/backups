- General caution: Everything you do will require Metamask interactions
- **Onboarding:** To join the pilot do the following steps
    - Install Metamask extension on your browser if you don't already have it installed.
    - If you're completely new to crypto stuff, you should probably do some basic things first like reading some 101 primers to get familiar with basic terms and concepts, buying or getting some ethereum somewhere, exploring some Web3 sites like opensea.io etc. Colony is an advanced Web3 dApp that leaves on what is known as an ethereum sidechain called Gnosis.  
    - Add Gnosis chain to Metamask at [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) and add your address to the list of members at the bottom of this page
    - Request some **xDai** (the Gnosis chain stablecoin -- a coin whose value is stabilized to be $1) from an existing member of the pilot... you only need fractions of a penny for most transactions so a small amount like 0.50 xDai will last a while
    - Go to [Colony](https://colony.io/), click "Launch App," sign in with your Metamask wallet, and create a name and profile, ^^make sure to add a profile pic^^
    - Go to [Yak Collective colony](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/yakcollective) and click **Join** on the right of the Colony name on the masthead
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FDkCNSL8Rgl.25.21%20PM.png?alt=media&token=c4a402fc-e00e-4cb1-8529-ed50ecc41772)
    - Once you do, the Yak Collective will appear in the left sidebar each time you sign in with your wallet
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F0N2pdA3G_4.25.40%20PM.png?alt=media&token=07ab1603-67be-440c-883a-2bc7912d5f7f)
    - Go to [Yak Collective on Clarity app](https://app.clarity.so/invite-link/N7MiFrMThG) and join that. Make sure you add your name and details there.
    - Ask for some YAKG (the governance token) and someone will send you 5 YAKG to get you started
    - Activate those tokens once you receive them, by clicking on the balance displayed on the upper right to open up the activation menu, this will allow you to "stake" those tokens for governance actions like proposing or objecting to motions -- see screenshot for what that will look like once you've activated your YAKG and staked a few things
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FePFjZkfPSh.22.43%20PM.png?alt=media&token=b42e0a8d-2c7e-44e5-963e-4109d7c1389f)
    - Go to Discord #ðŸŽªcolony-pilot-apr-1 channel and join the fun
- **Actions, Forcing, Motions, Objections, Voting**
    - Almost everything you can do on Colony will require 2 or 3 signatures in your Metamask wallet. This can take time and will cost small fractions of xDai (usually tenths of a penny at most)
    - **Initiating an Action:** You can initiate any action (eg make a payment, change permissions, add/remove people to teams) by creating a motion. Click the green-blue New Action button to see what you can do.
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FuhRZnW2B8Y.44.13%20AM.png?alt=media&token=e91e83c6-0c7b-4f12-b013-ebe53bf226cc)
    - **Forcing:** If you have appropriate permissions you will be able to "force" some actions (ie push them through without a vote) by moving the slider at the top right.
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F6OngGYv0Ry.41.50%20AM.png?alt=media&token=fba2d27d-835f-4203-bbb4-fddf7adbddeb)
    - **Creating and Staking Motions:** If you DON'T have appropriate permissions, it will create a "Motion" instead. You then have to stake some YAKG to activate the motion, and the motion will not even show in the Action stream until 10% of the required amount is staked. You will see this message. Make sure to copy the URL and post it in Roam/Discord because a motion or save it because you may need to round up enough to stake if you can't do it yourself.
        - You'll see this banner across the top
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FUUOE_CTrxP.50.00%20AM.png?alt=media&token=93c70681-7b75-4f6b-8887-0d7b64a2518c)
        - And this interface showing how much of the required amount is currently staked. This can be done by one or more people. If you have enough YAKG, your best bet is to stake it all yourself. If not, use the URL to round up support.
            - Others will **not** see the staking ask in the dAPP. Only discoverable through your sharing the URL in the `Share URL` pink eyebrow. 2022-02-10 #[[Jenna]]
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FD4RFbX7DSN.50.25%20AM.png?alt=media&token=0fdf9543-7f33-4cc2-829c-534dff141d36)
        - You stake by sliding the slider over. In this example, the whole amount is being staked (but hasn't been staked yet since it says 0%)
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FQJR5g8H99x.50.40%20AM.png?alt=media&token=91801d53-eea3-4780-9a05-d76723beb9a8)
        - Once you stake (2 metamask signatures, give it a minute), you'll see this staked display
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FQrc-SfGi2t.51.55%20AM.png?alt=media&token=3335a98d-b334-4930-9bd9-389aa62e464f)
        - Once a motion has been staked sufficiently (at least 10%), it will show up in the actions stream. If there are no objections, it will pass automatically and your stake will be returned to it. Here you can see examples of forced actions (happen immediately), staked actions (no objections, and will pass if not objected to), and voting in progress motions.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F8_4G8LvSW4.59.46%20AM.png?alt=media&token=ae006c4d-829b-4250-a441-d56c1dda5e6a)
    - **Objecting:** If you see a motion in the Action stream, it will be open to objections during the waiting period. Just click, click Object, and stake enough to trigger a vote. Then voting will be in progress and if the motion loses, the stake of the people proposing the motion will be lost.
- **Members** (add yourself and xDai address on metamask). This list should mirror the [Members Tab](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/yakcollective/members) on the Colony and ^^any mismatches should be investigated for potential security issues.^^
