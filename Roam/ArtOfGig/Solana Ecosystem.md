- Meta
    - Numerous projects with varying levels of quality. Most meta-content is on Twitter or Youtube (makes it hard to find definitive guides to the ecosystem).
    - Early 2000s internet company feel (huge valuations a la pets.com). 
        - Hard to sift through winners and losers. 
        - Playbook landing page + discord + telegram
    - Most projects require a lot of trust in organizer ability (games are getting built, LP farms have custom tokens)

    - Next Steps/Further Study
        - Update projects so this page becomes a higher quality version of the answer to the question "what Solana projects should YC keep tabs on". 
    - Example syntax: 
        - Category
            - <category notes>
            - example 1 <link>. description
                - notes on dApp 
- Games 
    - Strong parallels to the computer and internet, gaming likely to be beachhead for true blockchain governance. 
    - [Experience | Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/#). High production value MMORPG using Solana as an in-game currency/exchange.
        - MMORPGs market cap ~ $10B (sic) in 2022.

    - FAQs
        - What are the benefits of using Solana vs. Eth
            - Lower transaction costs, easier to develop/test for than Eth. 
            - Tradeoff is there are fewer validator nodes/more expensive to run validator nodes so greater centralization (in theory). 
        - Are there storage/domain systems built on top of Solana?
            - There is a [Solana Name Service | Bonfida](https://naming.bonfida.org/#/auctions) but couldn't find a good distributed storage system. Mostly DEXs have migrated to Solana. 
        - What are the technical differences of Solana vs. Eth? 
            - Proof of History vs. Proof of Stake. 
        - Why is Solana cheaper? 
            - Younger coin, lower total value of projects. 
    - Acronyms
        - CEX - Centralized Exchange. Exchange fiat/crypto currencies through conversion to dollars. Coinbase et al. 
        - DEX - Decentralized Exchange. Opposite of coinbase - direct exchange of coins.

        - Anonymous
            - [Audius](https://audius.co/). Music streaming. 
                - Would also add [nina.market](https://nina.market/) to this. Solana native, whereas Audius started Eth and then became cross-chain opperable.
