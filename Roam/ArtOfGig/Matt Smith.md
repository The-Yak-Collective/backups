- **Short Bio:** Located in Australia (near Melbourne) but these days I tend to work with clients outside of my country. My background is in instructional design, management consulting, training, change management, communications and management. 
  
  My passion and focus is on learning & development and I'm also very interested in changing how we think about, define and "do" work.
  
  My traditional consulting work has been:
  
  1. Helping Learning & Development (L&D) departments up-skill and develop a org-wide strategy 
  2. helping a business build (or rebuild) an L&D function 
  3. designing L&D projects for large scale change (e.g. digital transformation)
  
  __but__ I am much more interested in using my time now to really push the boundaries of using technology and art to accelerate people's development and growth.
  
  Previously founder/CEO of Pure Learning (a digital learning and consulting company) and have been in consulting for 10 years.
