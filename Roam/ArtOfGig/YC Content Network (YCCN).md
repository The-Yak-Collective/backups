- Content Aggregator/Network - YakC Content Network (YCCN)
    - Stage {{or: idea|considering|decided|WIP|done}}
    - Why?
        - How to leverage each Yak's audience/following?
        - Generate traffic to YakC web property
        - Increase awareness and engagement 
    - What?
        - Every Yak content outlet becomes part of the YakC Content Network
            - each outlet/post references/links the network (__part of the YCCN__)
            - has a bloc of suggested network reading (Outbrain style)
        - On top there's a YakC Aggregator - like Techmeme
            - links to network articles
            - original content
    - How?
        - needs some development - although you probably can use a mix of CMS + RSS + Zapier
        - some SEO expertise< might be needed
        - needs a clear pitch to the Yaks - why they should join the YCCN 
    - Potential barriers
        - technical complexity
        - low adoption from Yaks 
    - Project Pitch (draft)
        - Yak Collective Content Network: we have the opportunity to aggregate and leverage the individual audience of each Yak in a way that benefits both individual Yaks and the Collective. By building an interconnected network of content outlets (blogs, newsletters, podcasts,...) that drive and receive traffic/audience to/from a YC content Hub.
