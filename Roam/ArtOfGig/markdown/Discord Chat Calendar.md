- Discord was developed to support gamers playing games, so the medium is friendliest to that, so try to run voice chats in a video-game-ish spirit, whatever that means
- If you'd like to volunteer to host a weekly **VOICE chat session** on the [[Yak Discord server]], please add your name, time, and time zone below. Hosts, check out this page of [[Chat Formats]] for ideas on useful structured formats, and to add your own. Let's foll``````ow [the Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) for these chats.
- Best practices (HOSTS PLEASE READ!)
    - Hosts: please tweet a reminder no more than 30 minutes before the chat and tag @yak_collective. Also share your own twitter handle at the end of chats so people can follow you and get alerted. Include a bit of detail about the theme. For standing weekly chat sessions, please contact [[Venkatesh Rao]] to add to the calendar. It will get automatically tweeted and posted to events channel 15 minutes before, along with a temporary invite link.
    - Hosts: Include a link to this Roam page.
    - Pick or improv [[Chat Formats]] that have or generate a natural thematic focus so it's not chats for the sake of chats. The [[Amazonian Group Read]] is a good default.
