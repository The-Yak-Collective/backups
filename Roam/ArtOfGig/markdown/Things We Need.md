            - [Issue list on GitHub](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/issues)
            - [Issues where we could particularly use help](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) (though help is welcome everywhere!)
    - ~~Facebook page~~ 
    - Model for mutual boosting of newsletters, courses etc...
        - something like a webring? http://internetofnewsletters.com/
    - ~~Email newsletter~~
        - "We do need an email list, but I don't want to take on yet another infrastructure thing, so it's an open volunteer task. Something that simply pulls updates from a bunch of RSS feeds and perhaps notes on a target roam page and feeds it into a mailchimp or substack, with little to no human curation... that would be best." [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - Would love to create a weekly digest of Yak Members communications called "This Week in Yak" [[Alex Wagner]]
            - I would be remiss not to offer the name "Yakety Yak" for this Untitled_3 
- Shared sales model — perhaps a track of seminars by members, based on shared dev assets
- A better skills database than [[Directory]]
    - In the spirit of starting with what we've got and optimizing later, I'd propose that simply adding better structure to [[Directory]] would be a good next action vs. adding another tool to the mix. I volunteer to help with this. [[Scott Allen]]
    - [[Yak-Walk Map]] project is starting to address this 
- A better gig exchange mechanism than [[Take a Gig, Leave a Gig]]
- A way to automatically move links from discord to [[Case Studies]] and the sub-page [[Covid19 Case Studies]]
- [[Collaboration model/economy]]
    - A mutual subcontracting pricing model
    - A set of contracts/NDAs that allow any of us to easily rope in others via subcontracts
    - Something like a [[Blockchain]] (?) [[token]] IF it actually solves our problems
        - if this is *actually* desired to be pursued, I'd [[Greg Docter]] be happy to see what my [consensys](https://consensys.net/) network might have to offer
    - A way to price and accomplish internal admin/cost tasks
- Shared Basic Conversion model
    - A way to drive individuals-first gigflow
    - Some shared revenue-generating options to drive shared costs, such as a teachable account with courses that make enough to pay for basic infrastructure
- Commons knowledge development
    - A process to allow people to develop YC branded knowledge assets
    - A shared licensing model, probably CC-BY-SA or similar
    - A way to mutually train so any contributor to a collaborative effort can deliver it effectively 
- Commercial knowledge development
    - A way to develop higher-priced collaborative assets with shared profits among contributors
- Minimalist shared corporate infrastructure
    - Highly flexible participation  model... join/leave as you like, contribute as little/as much as you like
    - Ideally we wouldn’t even have a corporate core entity, just a protocol of mutual engagement.
    - At most we might eventually create a lightweight entity (for-profit or nonprofit or church) to own any shared assets like domain names etc.
    - Any actual paid team gig would be owned and run by the consulting vehicle of the lead person who brought in, priced, and staffed the project
    - A safety net of sorts... again maintained without shared infrastructure if possible. Like emergency grants to members, available in proportion to contributions etc.
- Community development / support
    - ~~A Twitter list of members would be helpful both in making it easier to engage with other yaks (vs. relying on Twitter's algorithms) and help increase visibility. I started to do one on my personal account, but then realized it should be on @yak_collective. I volunteer to set it up and help maintain it if I can get access to the Twitter account~~—[[Pamela Hobart]]? [[Venkatesh Rao]]?. ~[[Scott Allen]]
    - Experiment Dashboard
        - we need some sort of way to center trial-and-error experiments. But a discord channel or roam page seems week. More like a spreadsheet or dashboard showing everything we're trying right now.... voice chats, collaborative projects, a website, twitter etc etc... infrastructure is sort of orthogonal to the experimental dimension. Every experiment tries to spin up infrastructure piece, and every stable infrastructure piece supports one or more experiments.
        - [2:24 PM]
        - Some experiments are not very risky at all... doesn't take much to create and run a twitter account at a baseline level of effectiveness. But LinkedIn is harder, a voice chat series is harder still, and a collaborative deck series is the hardest of all

        - [[Greg Docter]] took Crack at this 5/10/20; perhaps totally wrong
            - https://discordapp.com/channels/692111190851059762/704369362315772044/709051885788856372
- Wish list (nice to have stuff)
    - A leaderboard with upvote/downvote for channel proposals. Doing it via thumbs up on the create-destroy-channel is kinda janky
    - A rolling proposals model instead of batch processing (once we're a few cycles in)
    - More cohesive twitter and marketing 
        - Way to capture discord convos -> marketing
- Linking this here... not quite the right place
    - "**Internal supporting things we need to support public output**"
