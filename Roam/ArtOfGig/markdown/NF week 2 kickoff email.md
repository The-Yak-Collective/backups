- Hope that first week of think-tanking and brainstorming was productive and interesting, and got you to a good starting line. We're now into the **Strawman Sprint**. Your draft module(s) are **due by the end of the week, Friday June 5th, 5PM US Pacific Time**. Here is the [skeleton deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CVZWUF-C7_b-dTZ3oiBYn3kE45CY6J3IEuEZO1TboEY/edit?usp=sharing), which should have almost everything you need to get going.
- We'll be sharing this rough draft with Bryan Johnson of Kernel for quick feedback. It'll be the only interim feedback we'll get, so it's important that we have all contributions in by the deadline, so I can assemble a pretty complete draft deck. If you feel unprepared to tackle your module, now is the time to let Jordan or me know so we can figure out how to backstop.
    - **Office hours with me are available on Tue-Wed-Thu**. These are 15 minute slots and are meant for quick shared brainstorms/editorial opinions on which direction to go if you're deciding among several. **These will be in the Discord office hours chat channel.** Here is the Calendly link: https://calendly.com/ribbonfarm/yak-collective-office-hour-slot
    - **Here are summaries** (big thanks to Rahul Ramchandani who is now the official project scribe, Jordan, and Nikhil) of the Week 1 think tank/brainstorm days. Please review them (especially for the days you weren't able to participate live in the discord).
        - Day 1: [Sensemaking/Brainstorm](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/xverM0qlA)
        - Day 2: [Family/personal folkways](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/lagGcOJBW)
        - Day 3: [Community/Culture folkways](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/wwbGQBJNk)
        - Day 4: [Societal/Macro folkways](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/GYGGYE_Yf)
        - Day 5: [Collision forces brainstorm](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/ge2lGzydn)
        - Extra: [Kernel meeting notes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/-EZ0EYLKF) (Jordan Peacock)
        - Extra: [Kernel tech 101](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/HlbDpq4O0) (Nikhil Deshmukh)
    - **Peer collaboration**: I encourage you to identify at least one sparring partner working on a related folkway and open up a DM conversation with them as you work on your folkway. The #Neurofuturama channel will of course be open and the discussion will continue there, so feel free to air your ideas for feedback as you need to. **If you need an expert opinion on any neuroscience/tech assumptions you want to make, tag Luke Butler or Nikhil Deshmukh. **
    - **Artwork: **Ryan Hume is the project artist, and we're going to do our best to have him do illustrations in a consistent style for all 24 folkway modules. These will be quick, impressionistic sketches, not super-detailed studies, so plan your module visuals accordingly. Here is the prompt he posted on Discord on Friday: __"Hey all, as we move into next week and your modules begin to come together please reach out to me directly about illustration opportunities for your module - a summary of your ideas directly from you will be the easiest way for me to start ideating on imagery :) If you have any questions before you’ve settled on your primary idea please reach out as well"__
    - **Work process**: I have rearranged the main [Neurofuturama Roam page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/Cap6_MuVN) to suit Week 2/strawman sprint needs. Look it over. It should have all the details you need. I'll be providing prompts and cues through the week on Discord. **All my editorial guidance is in the skeleton slide deck itself. **
    - Here's a screenshot of the current state of the Roam page with the Week 2 checklist expanded. It may change, so treat the actual page as canonical; this screenshot is just for reference:
