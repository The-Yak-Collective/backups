# Channel Categories
    ## Plaza
        General discussion and information channels.
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Public Plaza" → "Plaza".
            - Merge `announcements`, `events`, and `general`.
                -  [[Maier Fenster]] events should be separate and include only reminders for events. i think.
            - Move any channels from "Discussions" and "Bureaucracy" that don't properly fit under "Projects".
                - [[Maier Fenster]] by "merge in" you mean move or also combine?
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] Should have said "move". Fixed.
    ## Voice
        Voice channels (and associated text channels).
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Voice Channels" → "Voice".
    ## Projects
        Currently active internal and external projects. 
            - [[Maier Fenster]] maybe have separate groups for internal and external projects
                - [[Nathan Acks]] My thought was to mix them together, as I don't think we have that many... But I don't have a strong opinion.
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Merge in any channels from "Discussions" and "Bureaucracy" that don't properly fit under "Plaza".
    ## Incubator
        A place for new channels to find their legs. Or not.
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Probationary Channels" → "Incubator".
    ## Archives
        Old channels, put out to pasture. ^^**Important:** All channels in the "archives" should have the "send messages" permission disabled.^^
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Archived" → "Archives".
            - Make sure that all channels in this section have the "send messages" permission disabled.
            - Existing channels should be [reviewed to determine if they are still alive](((qI9wDK8cG))) and moved to the archives as appropriate.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] each should have a new title starting with "if you want this channel to come back to life do XXX"
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Maybe this should be in the channel description?
# Channel Lifecycle
    ## Birth
        - New channels are proposed in `create-destroy-channels`. All active yaks, made yaks, and yak shavers can propose new channels.
        - A channel that receives at least 3 "thumbs up" from different active yaks, made yaks, or yak shavers is born into the "Incubator".
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i think 3 are enough for incubator.
                - [[Nathan Acks]] Changed from 5 → 3
        - Channels in the incubator must show sustained interest for 1 month to be promoted to "Plaza", "Projects", or "Voice" (as appropriate).
            - __Sustained interest__ means posts from at least 3 yaks, with an __average__ (for the entire channel) of at least 1 post per day and no more than 1 week (for the entire channel) between any two posts.
                - [[Maier Fenster]] i say 3 yaks. and 1 week, not 3 days. there are holidays, you know
                    - [[Nathan Acks]] Change made
        - Channels in the incubator that do not show sustained interest are [archived](((qI9wDK8cG))).
    ## Life
        - Channels live in "Plaza" or "Projects", as appropriate.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i feel having more categories would be helpful
    ## Death
        - Yak shavers will monitor channels for signs of inactivity, culling inactive channels at least once per month.
            - An __inactive channel__ is one which has not received __any__ posts in 1 month.
        - Channels can also be culled if there is a proposal to do so in `create-destroy-channels` that receives at least 10 "thumbs up" from different active yaks, made yaks, or yak shavers, at least 2 of which have posted in the channel in the last month.
        - Culled channels are moved to the "Archives", and have their "send messages" permission disabled.
            [[Maier Fenster]] i would consider a temporary "being retired" category for a few weeks. and/or a post to members saying a channel is about to be retired, any objections.
    ## Resurrection
        - Any channel can be resurrected from the "Archives" by the same process by which it is [born](((dzV2mJs_4))).
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i feel resurrection should be easier
        - Resurrected channels have the same 1 month probationary period as newborn channels.
