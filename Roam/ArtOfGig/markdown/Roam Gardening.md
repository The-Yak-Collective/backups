- # Gardening principles 
    - Pages
        - each page needs to have a
            - [[Chief Page Wrangler]]
            - a [[template/header]]
        - Anyone can create a page as long they use the [[template/header]] and define a [[Chief Page Wrangler]]
- ## Roam CC Theme
    - should we choose a CSS theme? What theme brings value to the content experience?

            - Roam is hard enough to get going in that staying with stock seems like a high value.
            - I've tried various themes on my own graphs and so far they've end up borking something :} so I've go back to standard. Happy to have a Yak with better luck do a bit of customizing eg just our own color palette?
- # Gardening Workflow
    - anyone can mark a page or block with #needsupdate tag
    - A page that was re-organized is tagged with #gardened 
    - Archive
        - When do we delete/archive a page?
- 
- # Pages/blocks that need gardening
    - {{[[query]]: {and: [[needsupdate]] {not: {or:[[gardened]] [[Roam Gardening]]]}}}}}
