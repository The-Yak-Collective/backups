        - V2.2 website, backend clean up, documentation/code comments
            - Wanting to beef up the Roam page to help with onboarding other people 
        - Featured yak has some issues still
        - Nathan met with Sachin, Jenna, Chris re Astonishing Stories
            - Have dev test on structure of having projects that can have n arbitrary pages
        - Long-term move to Gatsby
            - allow for more robust data integrations
            - there's experiments with combining Roam + Gatsby as presentation layer

    - https://tilnow.github.io/docjs/index
        - Tried to look into how this could work in Roam using the mermaid diagram... can't link out to pages atm
    - Nathan - documentation sprint on Roam  [[Yak Collective Website]] page
    - discord changes were being implemented by Jordan + people he invited (ping Jordan for update)
    - Knack integration 
        - demo of website that pulls in data from Knack (which is itself a copy of github data) - almost works perfectly. there's a problem with Jekyll plugin -> member pages are getting wrong layout
    - gov question after the implementation is figured out... 
        - how do we want to handle - Jenna has been leading some of that [[Privacy Policy]]
            - how do we want to publicize
            - what level of controls

        - only required fields in YAML atm are Name and Avatar
            - tabled the idea of pulling that from discord (GDPR compliance)
                - people on website are the contributors to projects
            - do we want to have discord name? 
        - possibility of Roam-Web integration in a future version of the site in Gatsby
            - example: https://mathieudutour.github.io/gatsby-digital-garden/
            - concern on data consistency but will be addressed with Roam's new backend
    - move the chat to Sunday which is better for Nathan and Maier
    - revisit [[Threat Model]]
        - do another pass at the credential documentation in this page
        - currently share netlify account that is owned by our "robot" github account - we would need 3 members if we were to go paid $19 per member x3 members / mo

                        - What's the "minimum viable interaction" you need to feel included/part of?

            - internal fields for project contributions -> display member page

        - automate the production of yak talk more... center it more around project updates w/ editors providing commentary?

            - knack vs google form? 
                - allowing members to change data in knack with the rest of their profile... could be a separate section 
                    - GDPR
                    - can pull in the data via the API 
                - although updates don't HAVE to be real-time
            - are there fields that we want to add? 
            - bio cards
                - iframe?
                - api -> biocard will need help
                    - will be used to generate markdown format 
        - push to launch next week

    - participants:: [[Nathan Acks]] | [[Maier Fenster]] | [[Hershil Patel]] | [[Jenna Dixon]] | [[Vinay Débrou]]
    - Jenna has integrated the Yak Map questions into Knack.
        - So, the idea is to drive the Yak Map first, and __then__ create an account if that makes sense.
    - YakTalk is burned out. Too intense to produce.
        - Needs to be reconstituted.
    - Maier proposes "Yak Orbits" based upon [[Vaugh Tan]]'s work.
        - Maier's idea is to present this as a non-editable field.
        - Jenna thinks this assignable on the back end.
            - to display or not to display, on member profile #openquestion
        - This would be an additional number, in addition to the Discord level and heat map.
    - The idea is to use Vinay's Yak Map project to jumpstart data entry here.
        - Current conceptual levels (via Vinay):
            - Yaks (posted info)
            - Active Yaks (participating in any form)
                - Project Participants
            - Made Yaks (actually named in projects)
    - UID issues
        - Maier suggests we use the 15 digit Discord UID
            - General agreement that this is the way to go.
        - Vinay's using Discord username
    - Maier proposes that we push people from Discord -> Knack as part of onboarding
    - Jenna thinks we have Yak Map questions __first__ in Knack
        - Knack can send out welcome emails.
            - But Discord won't provide these (see below).
        - Vinay will send Jenna the initial scraped CSV. This CSV has the Discord UID.
            - [[October 5th, 2020]] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPpiOm17In1ZLQqcNeVh4lVc-7T21dOdtZ8zPOm9ONA/edit?usp=sharing
    - Maier points out that Discord only provides UID, username, and role
        - We can bootstrap these comms using Maier's `yak_scraper` robot
        - For the moment, we'll just DM people; later, we __may__ add interactivity.
            - Reminders will be on a timer.
