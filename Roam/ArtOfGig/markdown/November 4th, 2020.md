        - {{[[DONE]]}}  [[Future Frontiers]] Launch, [[Grigori Milov]] 
            -  Now that the Future Frontiers looks like a copy of Astonishing stories, it is probably time to get curious about Astonishing Stories stats. 
How many people read the first installments thus far? Do we understand the drivers of engagement?
Can we see the data from Substack (on the newsletter) and Google Analytics (on the website)?
Was there any meaningful discussion about outcomes we want to achieve with the never-ending but ever-surprising Future Frontiers project? Is it just to put some content on a website or in a newsletter?
                - the 2 projects looks similar
                - what can we do to help the launch
                - get understanding the plan from the project team
                    - what are we trying to achieve?
                - Newsletter - 350 w/ 50% open rate
                - Website - no numbers right now
                - we should have a call with [[Venkatesh Rao]] to understand the plan
                - We need to develop [[Marketing Channels]]
