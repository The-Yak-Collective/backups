# Assets
    - ^^This asset list is a work in progress, and is mostly based off of what [[Nathan Acks]] knows + SVG diagram development by [[Maier Fenster]]. If you work with or own a piece of infrastructure listed below, please visit the corresponding page and make sure all of the information's correct. And feel free to add services, etc. that we've missed!^^
    - [Roam diagrams](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/OB_uynVDM) are pretty limited; [[Maier Fenster]] has developed an SVG diagram that (currently) more completely captures the relationship between different components of the Yak Collective's IT infrastructure than is possible natively.
    - The symbols used in the infrastructure map have the following meanings:
        - {{[[table]]}}
            - **Symbol**

                - `STATIC_DATA`
