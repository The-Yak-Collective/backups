# Assets
    ^^This asset list is a work in progress, and is mostly based off of what [[Nathan Acks]] knows + SVG diagram development by [[Maier Fenster]]. If you work with or own a piece of infrastructure listed below, please visit the corresponding page and make sure all of the information's correct. And feel free to add services, etc. that we've missed!^^
    [Roam diagrams](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/OB_uynVDM) are pretty limited; [[Maier Fenster]] has developed an SVG diagram that (currently) more completely captures the relationship between different components of the Yak Collective's IT infrastructure than is possible natively.
    The symbols used in the infrastructure map have the following meanings:
        {{[[table]]}}
            - **Symbol**
                - **Macro**
                    - **Meaning**
            - Double Green Circle
                - `STATIC_DATA`
                    - Website or service that functions as a (relatively) static data source/destination
            - Green Oval
                - `EXTERNAL_SERVICE`
                    - Externally-facing web service used by YC members/participants (and sometimes others)
            - Blue Oval
                - `INTERNAL_SERVICE`
                    - Internally-facing web service used by few YC members (sometimes not accessible at all)
            - Blue Rectangle
                - `APPLET`
                    - A function, service applet, or internal tool; contained by and run by some service
            - Red Line
                - `USER_DATA`
                    - Manual data flow (someone creates an account, reviews a list and takes action, etc.)
            - Black Line
                - `AUTO_DATA`
                    - Automatic data flows (service takes action based on a timer, webhook, etc.)
