- # Bitwarden
    - I've not personally used this option.
    - ## Pros
        - The least expensive of the paid options
        - Tons of apps. Integrates with everything.
        - Looks easy to import/export data (CSV or JSON)
    - ## Cons
        - Costs money ($5/month for the first 5 users, $2/user/month thereafter)
        - Admins can easily gain access to all passwords
        - Only admins can import/export organizational data (which is all of the data we care about in our case)
    - ## Probably Best For...
        - ...Organizations that want to share passwords while having a nice user experience, and who aren't worried about their admins going rogue.
- # KeePass (and friends)
    - ## Pros
        - Free
        - Lots of clients
        - KeeWeb + Google Drive allows vault-level password sharing (read-write or read-only)
        - Limited versioning
            - Vault level with Google Drive
            - Password level -- but without blame -- in the vault. This is client-dependent.
    - ## Cons
        - Vault-level password sharing only
        - Only nice macOS/iOS apps are paid
    - ## Probably Best For...
        - ...Organizations who don't want to pay anything and have relatively simple team-based sharing needs.
- # Lastpass
    - ## Pros
        - Folder or individual password sharing
            - Individual password sharing is free, but has a "hub-and-spokes" model where the password isn't really "owned" by both people.
        - Master password recovery
        - Easy import/export.
    - ## Cons
        - Costs money ($4/user/month for shared folders)
        - Interface is very... Enterprise
        - Admins can easily gain access to all passwords
    - ## Probably Best For...
        - ...Organizations that want to share passwords and aren't worried about their admins going rogue.
- # 1Password
    - ## Pros
        - Beautiful
        - Works really __really__ well. **Really.**
        - Easy to add passwords
    - ## Cons
        - Cost money ($4/user/month)
        - Vault-level password sharing only
        - Hard to export passwords (if we decide to leave)
    - ## Probably Best For...
        - ...Organizations with well-defined teams who are willing to pay a premium for a world-class experience.
- # Pass (and friends)
    - ## Pros
        - Free
        - Full versioning via Git
        - Password sharing via multiple "stores" (at least when using [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/))
        - Password "ownership" is really about decryption, so very little worry about loosing access
        - Easy to import and export passwords... __If__ you're comfortable with the command line.
    - ## Cons
        - A bit technical to set up
            - __Abandon all hope, ye who fear the terminal__
        - Desktop and mobile clients are decidedly meh
        - GitHub becomes Class 1 infrastructure
        - One-store-per-password becomes awkward
        - No way to revoke password access -- passwords __must__ be rotated
        - "Easy to import and export passwords... __If__ you're comfortable with the command line."
        - Minor coordination problem: Passwords can be stored in a couple of different ways, so we'd all need to agree on one.
            - Fortunately, there's a template system for this
    - ## Probably Best For...
        - ...People who want/need fine grained password versioning and spend most of their time at the command line.
