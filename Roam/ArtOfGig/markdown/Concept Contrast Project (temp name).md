            - We were talking about viable old-fashioned journalism opportunity?
My suggestion is: we have the power to call out new controversial perspectives.
MVP Recommendation: find companies which are already going against the grain.
Scalability: take the approach, generalise and take to potential clients
        - Comments (Rafael) - Specifically, I was envisioning a short article regarding investigating organizations that are already pursuing alternative strategies to traditional consulting perspective. I consider the traditional consulting perspective to be central command and control. I think in the Reboot deck, they explain this in some examples.
