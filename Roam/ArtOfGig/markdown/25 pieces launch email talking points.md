- **Brief opening summary paragraph suggestions**
    - __Don't Waste the Reboot__  offers a smorgasbord of 25 non-mainstream ideas, systems, provocations, and frameworks to help leaders navigate the Covid-19 reboot. The goal is to offer organizations of all sorts ‚Äî business, nonprofit, government ‚Äî a real and meaningful alternative to traditional mainstream sources of advice, counsel, and intelligence for navigating this crisis. Here are some details:
- **Details to potentially include**
    - The deck is organized around six core themes: 
        - Response & Learning
        - Experimentation & Innovation
        - Reboot Mental Models
        - Sensemaking & Storytelling 
        - Complexity & Resilience 
        - Deploying Indies  
    - My contribution to this deck is Idea #X, <NAME OF YOUR IDEA HERE>  (ON SLIDE NUMBER). <SUMMARIZE IT BRIEFLY IN 1 SENTENCE>. 
    - Besides my own, another idea I particularly liked was <NAME OF ANOTHER IDEA HERE>  (ON SLIDE NUMBER). <SUMMARIZE IT BRIEFLY IN 1 SENTENCE>... 
    - Try to highlight at least 1-2 ideas that are NOT your own, so we put the "collective" into this thing.
- **About The Yak Collective**: 
    - The Yak Collective is a network of independent consultants who all have their own consulting practices, but also work together on larger projects. If you are intrigued by an idea/framework, feel free to reach out to the relevant contributor directly. The Yak Collective is not an agency or intermediary. We are trying to develop a very different approach of developing and delivering business ideas and intelligence based primarily on effective and fluid collaboration models inspired by the open-source software world. You can learn more about us at our new website, [yakcollective.org](https://yakcollective.org)
- **Calls to Action suggestions** (include as many of these as you think fit)
    - **Read the deck!**: We are NOT interested in shallow, clickbaity virality for this report. We'd rather reach and connect with people and organizations who are actually interested in the ideas we've been thinking about. So take 5 minutes to just browse the deck first, before sharing.
    - **Retain our services**: If your organization is interested in one or more of the ideas included in the report, and would like a workshop or a freeform conversation, let me know, and I'll help set it up. One or more of us from the Yak Collective can develop an offering suited to your particular needs (more info in the deck).
    - **Help us reach decision-makers**: If you'd like to help us out, you can do so by spreading this word in your network. Just forward this email to decision-makers at organizations you think could benefit from discovering these frameworks. 
    - **Spread the word**: You can help us out by sharing the deck on social media. [Link To Deck- Don't Waste the Reboot](https://yakcollective.org/reports/yak-wisdom)

- **Marked for deletion**
    - Instead of awaiting the next "new normal" as Big Consulting industry lazily terms it and playing catch-up, it's time to get started on establishing an early-lead in the coming decade of rebuilding. This special report of the 'Yak Wisdom Project' is lined with powerful strategic frameworks-- one of these can be your regeneration launch-pad.  
    - **Note:** Unlike the oversimplified decks from Big Consulting you may have seen floating around, this deck does not attempt to provide a Grand Unified Theory of crisis management and recovery. All contributors operate as independent professionals, driven by curiosity to discover and build creative solutions rather than sticking to warmed-over consulting tropes & strategy clicheÃÅs. 
    - I think we should adopt anti-viral models. Low-friction canned tweets like this don't add much value, but personalized tweets do.
