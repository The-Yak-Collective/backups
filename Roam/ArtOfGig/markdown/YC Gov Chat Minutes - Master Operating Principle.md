    - We will read 3 very short extracts today in the governance chat. A bit from Hitchhikers Guide, a bit from the Wind in the Willows, and wikipedia page on the CAP theorem. Together all 3 should take under 10 minutes.
    - 1. Hurling Frootmig principle: https://sites.google.com/site/h2g2theguide/Index/h/206017

    - 2. Vanishing Otter norm: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Wind_in_the_Willows.djvu/29

    - 3. CAP theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem
        - [Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model): Every read receives the most recent write or an error
        - [Availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability): Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
        - [Partition tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partitioning): The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes
    - The goal/prompt: try and conceptually connect these into a master operating principle for YC. We will wrap the governance chat at 9:30 and then do a quick chat on the #future-frontiers project. Join for either/both.
    - update: pick two of three
