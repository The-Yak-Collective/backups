- This is a bunch of ideas which would make suitable contributions to the [[Future Frontiers]] project. Each should take 2-4 hours of thought and composition at most, to generate a few slides and text. See [the website](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/) for already published examples. Contact [[Venkatesh Rao]] for editorial support/brainstorming. You can of course make up your own ideas. The only requirement is that the idea be relevant to contemporary frontiers, and have a "democratization of exploration" angle to it.
