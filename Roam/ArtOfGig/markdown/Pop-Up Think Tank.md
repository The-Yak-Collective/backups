- The Pop-Up Think Tank is the first offering model developed by the Yak Collective. 
- So far there are 2 instances, [[Donâ€™t Waste the Reboot]] 
- (our first [[Internal Project]] and [[Neurofuturama]] (our first [[Client Project]])
- Runs for between 2-6 weeks
- Delivers a deck of ideas, insights, provocations, frameworks, and models around a chosen topic area
- Built around an efficient [[Coordination Model]] that has already been validated on one or more internal projects, and set up to accept contributions from between 6-30 people.
- Potential phases of the model
    - Discovery/brainstorm/learning week (for projects requiring some technical prework to contribute to)
    - Week long sprints each resulting in an improved version
    - Refinement week
