# Yaks
    - Anyone who is a member of the YakC Discord server or who has made a significant contribution to a YakC project is considered a "yak". There are four "types" of yaks.
        - contradiction: if they did not make a significant contribution, they may still be yaks
    - ## New Yaks
        - __New yaks__ are people who have joined the YakC Discord server, but who have not yet posted an introduction.
        - New yaks who do not post an introduction within 1 week of joining are culled from the herd.
        - [[Maier Fenster]] are they actually kicked off the server?
    - ## Active Yaks
        - All yaks who have at least made an introduction on the YakC Discord server are considered __active yaks__.
        - Active yaks may participate in YakC projects and, if they desire, are eligible for inclusion on the [[Yak Network Map]].
        - [[Maier Fenster]] how actually active do they need to be?
    - ## Made Yaks
        - __Made yaks__ have made a significant contribution to a YakC project.
            - Such project can be externally facing (__e.g.__, [[The New Old Home]]) or internally facing (__e.g.__, [[YC Marketing - distributed CMO]]).
            - Ideally, __all__ projects should be featured on the [[Yak Collective Website]]. As of [[November 9th, 2020]], only externally facing projects are currently featured, but [this needs to be fixed](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/issues/29).
        - The elevation to made yak is determined by the lead editors of the project that yak contributed to. All made yaks should be listed in a project's credits.
            - Occasionally, a made yak may be someone from outside of the YakC Discord server if that person has made significant contributions to a YakC project. __This should be the exception, rather than the rule.__
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i prefer that ALL people involved in YC be on discord server. otherwise, just give them honorable mention or whatever.
        - If they desire, made yaks are eligible for inclusion on the [[Yak Network Map]].
    - ## Yak Shavers
        - __Yak shavers__ are YakC Discord server admins.
        - If they desire, yak shavers are eligible for inclusion on the [[Yak Network Map]].
