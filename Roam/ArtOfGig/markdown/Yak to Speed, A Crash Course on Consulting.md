    - **WHAT is consulting?**
        - i am not a consultant, but i am coming to view it as outsourced outside-of-the-box thinking, provided as a service for organisations that are structured by and with and through inside-the-box-thinking (which is necessary for them to operate smoothly, predictably, and with consistent culture/ritual). - [[Damian Stewart]]
        - Those that can, do. Those that can't, teach. Those that can but choose not to, consult. - [[Tom Critchlow]]
        - business-metaphysical country doctor-ing. maybe "maker of unknown-unknowns into known-unknowns" - [[Alex Wagner]]
        - Game-in-the-head > head-in-the-game. Makes sense after a few rounds with different client types - [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - I think about consulting in terms of jobs to be done, which are a few: -- [[Paul Millerd]]
            - 1. Deep information gathering sensemaking
            - 2. Too-hard-to-hire finite projects (M&A)
            - 3. Executive insecurity support
            - 4. Targeted expertise
            - 5. Coaching & sparring
            - 6. Hands-on iterative work partner
            - 7. Cover-your-ass
    - **WHY is there a market for consulting?**
        - running a successful business is about finding a success and then reproducing that success as often as possible with as little effort as possible. the kind of environment necessary to do this is not likely to foster highly independent thought or independent thinkers. but sometimes, you need independent thought (for example, to understand __why__ your success was a success, or to suggest new __kinds__ of things you might be able to build from your first success). enter, consulting - [[Damian Stewart]]
        - All orga  nizations operate with some level of dysfunction. Essentially, a consultant helps organizations become more efficient. There are numerous ways to do this but it seems to come to improving: processes, communication, and decision-making within the org. - [[Alex Wagner]]
            - tl;dr -  consultants are therapists for corporations - [[Krish Khubchand ðŸŽˆ]]
    - **WHEN does an individual or company best benefit from, or need, consulting?**
        - When they have a problem they don't know how to solve. When the individual or company is in a sufficient amount of pain to act and hire a consultant. [[Alex Wagner]]
    - **HOW does consulting work?  **
        - Here's a hypothetical six-step process, typed from memory: [[Alex Wagner]]
            - 1.** First contact**: Client reaches out because of referral or seeing consultant's content, or a chance conversation occurs in meatspace or online, and a client reaches out to inquire.
                - There's also engaging with client via Request for Proposal(RFP) put out by client. This can be a lengthy process. Suggest avoiding submitting proposal for RFP unless you have a champion inside the org, or you are able to redefine the RFP on your own terms.
            - 2. **Diagnosis**: On a call, consultant asks thoughtful questions to tease out problem, spending at least 75% of call listening(typically). 
                - There is an element of "discovery" here. Consultant needs to be able to zero in on clients' actual pain point(often different than what the client believes it to be), but expend only a reasonable amount of energy here, as winning the project is not guaranteed. 
                - The consultant may have several calls like this per week(or more), and as such, needs to simply deliver a diagnosis. It's critical that the consultant __not solve the client's problem__ here, and talk themselves out of a gig.
                - Will create a doc for [[Consultant Sales Call Questions]].
            - 3. **Proposal**: Based on conversation between client and consultant, consultant submits a proposal. Can be brief â€“ a couple of pages â€“ or a carefully-delineated project scope, 7-8 or more pages. 
                - Proposal is essentially an experiment, a compelling-enough bet that consultant crafts, and client believes enough in to invest part of org's discretionary or previously-allocated budget.
                - Usually good to provide three different pricing options here, and let the client pick the one
            - 4. **Engagement**: Client signs off on proposal, and pays consultant 30-50% of project fee to kick-off project. At this point, consultant begins project work in earnest.
            - 5. **Project Updates:** Consultant and client/client's team have regular calls and meetings. Consultant is often embedded in clients' team.
            - 6. **Project Completion:** Consultant reports on results of project, in what's often called a post-mortem/debrief/project wrap-up. Some projects are one-offs from the beginning, but the ideal outcome is a long and satisfying relationship with the client, with many repeated engagements.

    - [The Strategy of Preeminence](https://www.abraham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The_Strategy_of_Preeminence-Adapted-for-a-Client1.pdf) by Jay Abraham
        - Jay Abraham may be best known for his "Strategy of Preeminence" model for attracting clients and navigating relationships with them. It fully defines being "client-focused" as a strategic mindset. AFAIC, should be required reading for service providers and consultants, especially with regards to business ethics. [[Alex Wagner]]
            - Additional reading: [Getting All That You Can Out of Everything You've Got](http://abraham-pop.s3.amazonaws.com/GettingEverythingNew.pdf) â€“ Abraham's most popular book.
        - Most freelancers, creatives, non-business people get triggered by the thought of asking for referrals. Creating effective strategy, doing sales call, etc, asking for referrals is an art. This book will help you grow your consulting practice more efficiently, and faster than you might otherwise. [[Alex Wagner]] 
    - [The Speed of Trust](https://public.summaries.com/files/8-page-summary/the-speed-of-trust.pdf) by Stephen Covey
        - Teams that trust each other do great work and are the definition of "head-in-the-game". Covey's book gives a compelling thesis that trust is the core currency in business. [[Alex Wagner]]
