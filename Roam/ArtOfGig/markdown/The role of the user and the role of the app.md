- An overly simplified look at this as this is all too short for a complicated subject.  
    - In my opinion: the role of the app is to enable the user to accomplish their goals while minimizing the effort required from the user.  The user then needs to fulfill their behavioral requirement in order to accomplish said goals.  The user will often be asked to do things that they are not used to doing, and that's okay- if they were already doing those things, then the user would not need an app to help them to accomplish their goals.  However, the app should then be designed in such a way as to encourage the user to fulfill their behavioral requirement.
        - This is not to say that the app needs to be watered down, but only that the app should, as a general principle, not be harder than it needs to be for what it is trying to do, and should facilitate the process of the user learning what they need to learn in order to have [[high [[user involvement]]]].
- **The best an app can do is provide access to value.  The user needs to take advantage of that access, and the app can support the user in doing so.**
- Conversation b/w user, app, and company:

-User expresses what they want verbally and behaviorally
-App says “huh, that’s interesting” and guides the user towards what they want
-App tells the company what it learned. Company says “huh, that’s interesting” and adjusts

Repeat.
