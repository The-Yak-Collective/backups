    - ## Proofreaders
        - __Proofreading is the final step in the editorial cycle before publication. A proofreader looks at an increment of text on the manuscript and compares it to the corresponding typeset increment and marks any errors. Proofreaders have no editorial authority; they can mark queries for typesetters, editors, or authors.__
