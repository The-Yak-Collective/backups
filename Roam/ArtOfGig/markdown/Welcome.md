- Welcome to the [[Art of Gig]] community Roam database. The goal is to build a resource that is long-term useful to the gig economy community, starting with immediately useful things related to the [[Coronavirus and the Gig Economy]] test
- [[Sandbox Page]] for people unfamiliar with Roam, and a [Help Database](https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1308)
- Create pages at will, and under the right top-level pages where it makes sense, or make a new top-level page if it makes sense. Cross-link liberally. Don't worry about page titles. They can be easily updated and globally changed, and merged with other pages when there is redundancy.
- Now check out the [[Rules and Code of Conduct]] page, then go to the [[Index]] page and start exploring, editing etc.
