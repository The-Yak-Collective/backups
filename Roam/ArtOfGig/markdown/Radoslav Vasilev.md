- I am a digital strategy consultant, marketer and recovering co-founder, based in Sofia, Bulgaria. Have diverse experience and accumulated insights in various industries (telco, fintech, blockchain/DLT, travel, e-commerce, education, publishing, new media, SaaS, etc.) 

My passion and current focus are marketing reinvention, transitioning from growth to de-growth paradigms, information asymmetry and research/development of a decentralized digital history stack. 

I am here to collaborate helping this experiment to evolve from pulsating community protoplasma into a high-end functioning swarm of strategy consultants, practitioners, and tinkerers.
