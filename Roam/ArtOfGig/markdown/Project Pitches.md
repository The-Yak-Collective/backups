- About:: Main directory page for continuous project pitching and greenlighting. Data on this page will be used for automated creation of suitable scaffolding on the [[Yak Collective Website]], trigger some automated publicity on the [[Yak Talk]] newsletter, and potentially some marketing activity from the [[YC Marketing - distributed CMO]] team. So **please stick to the pro-forma.** You propose projects by adding a proposal block in the "**Projects List**" section. See "Notes::" for additional details.
- Time-sensitive announcement:: Draft projects added before Dec 1 will get an opportunity to live-pitch their project and solicit contributors at the [[YC Annual Meeting 2020]] on Dec 10. First-come first-serve for pitching slots.

- TO PROPOSE A PROJECT::
    - Copy the metadata template block below for **Sample Project**, paste it at the TOP of the "**Projects List**" section just below it, and populate it.  The __%% italicized text__ is help-comments you can **delete. At minimum, you will need to have identified a backup lead name before the proposal is considered "proposed", otherwise it is draft.**
        - "[[Sample Project]]: Brief 1-2 sentence pitch/blurb."
    - Populate the project's own page as you see fit.
    - Propose a Discord channel, share your project's page in it once it is created, and invite people to join the channel as either potential participants or interested supporters/watchers. You may have to go actively recruiting.
    - Show up at a [[Yak Collective Governance]] chat (Friday mornings 9 AM Pacific) to live-pitch your project informally to people. We'll be starting a section of the chat for that. 
    - If you have critical mass by your launch date, your project status will shift to **Started** and things may start to automatically happen, like a page appearing on the website, an announcement in the newsletter etc.
- [[Sample Project]]: Brief 1-2 sentence pitch/blurb.
    -  %% __Project name should be a short phrase that should link to a detail page which you are free to structure as you see fit (click sample project page link for ideas). The 1-2 sentence pitch blurb should be a succinct summary of the idea that can also serve as placeholder text for the webpage that will be automatically created__

    - [[Hack US Gig Worker Healthcare]]: The US healthcare "debate" is focused on full-time workers & employer-based insurance.  We will design some piece of creative content (deck, essays, video) designed to persuasively re-frame the debate around US healthcare and the intangible cost on lost creativity, entrepreneurship and mental well-being of gig workers.

            - Could pursue sponsorship, but happy doing this out of my own time too
        - **Comments** Right now the idea space in terms of fixing US healthcare for gig workers is essentially Aspen Institute "portable benefits" programs which really don't solve the problem they claim to solve or California "turn everyone into full-time employees" fixes that are stuck in the 20th century rather than any real attempt at trying to find something that works.
    - [[Yak Rover]]: A project to design a real Mars rover prototype that can actually be built and trialled on Earth, and evolved into a production model that could potentially even be launched to Mars.
        - Current State:: {{or: Draft | Proposed | Started | Stalled | Live | Finished | Abandoned }}
        - **Core Team** (minimum 2, maximum 4) 
            - Project Lead:: [[Venkatesh Rao]]
            - **Backup Lead**: TBD. Would like somebody good at electronics design.
            - **Optional**: Would like somebody good at systems software.
            - **Optional**: Would like somebody good at simulations and maps
        - Additional Members:: We are actually going to try and make an open-source design that anyone can use to actually build a small rover. So mainly looking for people with appropriate engineering/making skills in mechanical design, electrical/electronic design, system software, controls, sensors, navigation etc. etc. 
        - **Kickoff Date**: 01/01/21
        - **Launch Date**: 12/01/21

    - [[Quadrantology]]: A client project to create a revenue-generating personality test based on the assets already created and prototyped by [[Venkatesh Rao]] (who will be both client and project lead) at [quadrantology.com](https://quadrantology.com). The completed project output will be licensed to YC as a revenue-generating asset, with royalties to client (Venkat) and residuals (like a movie) to participants. Details tbd.
        - Current State:: {{or: Draft | Proposed | Started | Stalled | Live | Finished | Abandoned }}
        - **Core Team** (minimum 2, maximum 4) 
            - **Project Lead**: [[Venkatesh Rao]] -- I've done about 70% of the work already.
            - **Backup Lead**: Name 2 -- Needs a CTO basically for the online version.
            - **Optional**: Name 3 -- Tabletop game designer person to take the assets and playtest results to the next level

        - **Launch Deliverable: ** Table-top game and online personality test
        - **Financial Structure**: Client Project ([[Venkatesh Rao]] would be the client)
        - **Comments:** I've already done 70% of the work on this project (see [the quadrantology website](https://quadrantology.com)). I've designed and validated the personality test and underlying theory, designed and play-tested a set of game assets, and trialled a version of the online personality test using typeform and Matlab based test processing. I'd assign a license to YC to develop it into a revenue-generating asset, with royalties for me as creator of the underlying IP and some sort of residuals scheme (tbd) for people who participate in the project to get it live and maintain it.
- Notes::
    - See also: [[Production Cell]] page maintained by [[Jenna Dixon]] for production support that will be available, and the [[Available YC Funds]] to see how much financial support is currently available.
    - Unlike the old proposals [[Greenlighting Process]] (now deprecated), which had both a Roam page component and a google forms component, which was used for the first two cycles (May and July 2020), this process will solely be based on Roam, Discord, and automated/semi-automated activities triggered on github and the website.
