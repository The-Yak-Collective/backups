- [[Evidence Based Design]] for the [[built environment]] [[Great Indoors]]
    -  Feng Shui (Chinese: 風水) claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment [architecture] in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as [qi]. literally "wind-water
        - Brilliant topic to address, yet woo to wooth-power in terms of its tenets

        - architectural folk knowledge deserves to be examined and evaluated according in terms of measurable observations and comparisons between distinctive experiences.
    - High quality evidence exists in pockets, yet there's no path to accumulate validated knowledge as the crisis normalizes
        - [[Evidence Based Design]] has lots of usable guidelines, BUT
        - [[Soft infrastructure]] is too frequently neglected. Many [[behavioral problems]] are poorly addressed by technological solutions 
        - [[Behavioral Economics]] is all about the gap between knowledge and action
            - DIY hackers proliferate [[McGyver]] innovations 
            - Marketplace will be crowded with non-factual claims
            - Corporations can benefit from providing packaged solutions to their home office workers
    - What Yak Collective could contribute
        - Evolve an Aeron Chair for the mind
            - Also a Bicycle for the body of that worker
            - A dojo or temple for the Spirit
        - Step 1: Review and taxonomize hacks that address any of the following:
            - Noise and sound control
            - Biophilia in the presence of nature
            - Ritual spacing and control of intent
            - Privacy enhancement
            - e-Sociable milieus
        - Step 2: Develop packaged solutions that incorporate best approach to modifying the [[Built environment]],
            - Packaged solutions could be post-facto analyzed in terms of variance across independent factors
                - Crucial variable: Behavioral adoption of the [[Soft infrastructure]]
            - Further iterations, based on earlier experiments, could converge on fully manufactured  
    - [[ergonomic]] level of analysis
        - #Lighting
        - #Sound
        - [[Traffic flow]]
        - [[enrichment]] (e.g #windows and #plants)
        - [[Soft infrastructure]] less well studied
            - Ritual structure to contain distinct #behavior
    - The marriage of [[User Centered Design]]  with [[Positive Psychology]] 
        - [[User Centered Design]] discipline
            - originated with man-machine [[ergonomics]] using mostly psychophysics (reaction times, just noticeable differences, speed vs accuracy)
            - Renamed [[Human-Computer Interaction]] because computers are very special machines
                - HCI tracks the furniture of our minds' [[mental models]]
                    - Psychological tendencies and preferences define the fundamental laws of HCI
                - "Tiny pieces of psychology" continually mined by companies, refined through [[A/B testing]]
                    - Make or break dimensions have such a fine granularity that separates similar implementations (e.g. Zune vs iPod)
            - [[Positive Psychology]] is not actually a discipline, so much as an orientation
                - Shifts focus from pathology to optimization 
                    - e.g., [[Csikszentmihalyi]] studied [[Flow]]
                    - Grit, gratitude, and healthful practices included
                    - [[BJ Fogg]] [[Motivation]] made easy
                - Guiding Assumption: The power of [[situation]] to influence behavior. [[Behavioral Economics]] labels this the [[framing]], and it's often more potent than knowledge of the facts
    - [[extreme populations]] offer universal insights [[Great Indoors]]

        - Extreme populations (neuro-atypicals) have needs that could benefit general population

            - Minimize random exposure to non-self 
                - Quote: "Information technology obviates #queuing: patients call in advance, check in at kiosks or by smartphone, and receive printed directions to examination rooms, aligned in staggered positions along corridors to make #wayfinding signage visible at a distance with minimal supervision" https://archpaper.com/2015/10/a-prescription-for-place/
            - [[Acuity Adaptable]]: bring medical care to patient's dedicated [[room of one's own]]
                - Quote:  "realistic scenario calls for acuity-adaptable rooms to rotate between Intermediate Care and Medical/Surgical unit; instead of doubling a room’s size, the most significant of these requirements would be an increase in minimum clear floor area (20sf), and medical gas outlets"
