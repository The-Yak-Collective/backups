    - Why?
        - How to leverage Yak's audience/following
        - Generate traffic to YC web property
    - What?
        - Every Yak content outlet becomes part of the YC Content Network
            - each outlet/post references the network 
            - has a bloc of suggested network reading (Outbrain style)
        - On top there's a YC Aggregator - like Techmeme
            - links to network articles
            - original content
    - How?
        - needs some development - although you probably can use a mix of CMS + RSS + Zapier
        - needs a clear pitch to the Yaks - why they should join the YCCN
