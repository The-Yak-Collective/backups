    - I wanted to semi-publicly play out some of the great-ape thinking here to see what clicks. Thinking about Freedom Ways in terms of expanding cluster of liberties for brains unlike our own (be it for personhood or metricizing quality of life)
    - Great Ape Personhood movement has made some progress in conferring weak rights to apes.
    - Singer: "If people claim that great apes are not as rational as humans are, or cannot use language as we can, we can reply that we do not deny personhood to human beings who lack the ability to reason or to use language".
    - Public opinion cc that could change 'pet ways', food ways, and general attitudes towards activities that disturb other animals. 
    - Cottage industry of kernels for pets proliferates. Arguably useful for training, quickly kept on animals because people care what their pets feel. e.g. unusual distress signals could signal a call from the owner. Maybe the language of ownership is blunted. (Maybe these kernels are invasive).
    - Surviving live meat supplychains feel obligated to monitor and report on the wellbeing of any mammals in their care. (Perhaps we presume these are largely replaced by synthetic meats etc anyway, making public opinion on meat supply chains more malleable). Maybe they're abolished in some of the world.
    - Among humans- old, infirm, differently abled, and young can make their preferences known and get some kind of considerations that were not technically possible before. Could tie to speech ways.
    - Daren Kong: 
        - like what's the impact of that on education for children re schools as "prisons" 
        - or lowering the age of X _ because we have markers of neuro development
    - Venkat:
        - Hmm. The collision trend is vat-grown meat. You want to cash out this scenario in a way that points at the neural potential for more creative liberty boundaries rather than at an animal rights impasse.
        - This one is pretty fraught, but I think we should carefully step over the line into tough conversations on at least a couple of folkways
        - This is a good candidate. Factory farming is in the cross-hairs for labor and ethics reasons, lab meat is on its way, climate change is another reason, and vegan ism/vegetarianism is growing along with the culture war associated with it.
    - Nikhil
        - The animal pain angle is one of much debate in the neuroscience community
        - Good summary here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_fish
- Revised for Straw Draft
    - NaaS helps to quantify quality of life among humans, helping to demonstrate harms and benefits that were much more speculative before. This view creates challenges of all kinds to prisons, schooling, work environments, and other behaviors and institutions
    - The widespead use of NaaS expands the horizons of empathy and liberties beyond even humankind
    - The Ape Personhood Movement is a springboard for conferring rights to a wider away of animals
        - Singer: "If people claim that great apes are not as rational as humans are, or cannot use language as we can, we can reply that we do not deny personhood to human beings who lack the ability to reason or to use language".
        - Activist enery shifts from "similar minds" arguments for personhood (protecting great apes from being imprisoned unlawfully, etc. on the basis that they are like us, social and self-aware in specific ways) to a broader appreciation about the mental lives of other animals.
        - Pet distress becomes a point of friction in some segments of society. 
    - Surviving live meat supplychains feel obligated to monitor and report on the wellbeing of any mammals in their care. (Perhaps we presume these are largely replaced by synthetic meats etc anyway, making public opinion on meat supply chains more malleable). Maybe they're abolished in some of the world. 
        - Vegetarianism and veganism for health and ethical reasons is already well on the rise. The contributions of livestock to climate change has already politicized the issue, contributing to widespread adoption in many places. Synthetic meats having been plummeting in costs since the 2020s. Factory farming is treated with abhorence.  
- Take 2 (Revised POV, raw notes further below)
    - Incremental/legal movement: neuroscience today:
        - The most common current employment of neuroscience in the courts is not related to deception detection, nor to any kind of forensic application; instead, the most frequent use of neurological evidence is by the defense ([Shats et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00621/full#B80)), usually arguing for diminished capacity, insanity, or pleading for mitigation ([Seiden, 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00621/full#B79); [Farahany, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00621/full#B17); [Shen, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00621/full#B82)).
            - This could advance: demonstrating harms and benefits, quantifying quality of life. 
        - The right to mental privacy chips away at the concept of mens rea. 
        - Certain cognitive liberties are being defined today.
    - Mass culture: Adapted definitions of "**Autonomy**"
        - Individual people have the right to "**self-government**" in a cognitive sense. (Also matches w/ Kantian Moral Autonomy)
        - Contracts of all kinds will made to be more explicitly **euvoluntary**: contract signatories can confirm and cross-confirm that each of them experienced and agreed with the terms and conditions; that each of them were of sound mind, with no evidence of damage or cognitive subterfuge; that they are indeed the agents denoted in the contract, etc.

                - Cognitive Liberty, Mental Privacy, Right to Mental Integrity, Right to Psychological Continuity
                    - Lawyers are already talking about a right to cognitive liberty. It would entitle people to make free and competent decisions regarding the use of technology that can affect their thoughts. A right to mental privacy would protect individuals against unconsented-to intrusion by third parties into their brain data, as well as against the unauthorized collection of those data. Breaches of privacy at the neural level could be more dangerous than conventional ones because they can bypass the level of conscious reasoning, leaving us without protections from having our mind read involuntarily. This risk applies not only to predatory marketing studies or to courts using such technology excessively but also to applications that would affect general consumers
                    - Finally, a right to psychological continuity might preserve people's mental life from external alteration by third parties.

    - **Albion's Seed: on Freedom Ways & Cultural Transmission**
        - American folkways, rephrased
            - The founder's DNA of the early United States traces back to four British migrations, and their cultural practices laid the foundation of American culture to which future migrant groups adhered or gently adapted:
                - Massachusetts Order: New England Puritans brought East Anglian culture to the Americas. This folkway is characterized by relative homogeneity, stable families, older demographics, and a more balanced sex ratio.
                - Virginia Hierarchists: Royalist Cavaliers brought cultural conceptions from the south of England. These folks fought for hierarchy in the past and want a society structured that way. They ordered their society in an extremely hierarchical manner following the Anglican church and institutionally deeply tied to the crown and systems of rank and status.
                - Delaware Pluralists: Quakers in the middle colonies brought their experiences from the North Midlands. Their persecution led them to a more pluralistic/peacekeeping view (vs a hierarchy or unity focus) with an eye on commerce.
                - Backcountry Libertarians: Borderland folk (lowland Scots, northern Irish, and northern British) informed Appalachian culture. 
        - Reference: Freedom Ways (direct quotations)
            - The presence of four different "freedom ways" worked together to necessitate an expansive pluralism and libertarianism in order to accommodate all of them.
            - Direct Quotations from Albion's Seed on Freedom Ways
                - [Massachusetts Freedom Ways: The Puritan Idea of Ordered Liberty](https://erenow.net/common/fourbritishfolkwaysinamerica1989/35.php)
                    - Collective Liberty
                        - Liberty of the community, (vs individual). "Liberty of New England/Boston/The Town"
                        - "New Englanders willingly accepted individual restraints, but insisted that they should be consistent with written laws which they called the “fundamentals of the commonwealth."
                    - Individual Liberties
                        - When it referred to individuals, it often became a plural noun—“liberties” rather than “liberty.” These plural liberties were understood as specific exemptions from a condition of prior restraint—an idea which had long existed in East Anglia and in many other parts of the western world.
                        - The laws of the Bay Colony granted some liberties to all men, others to all free men, and a few only to gentlemen. For example, a “true gentleman” and “any man equal to a gentleman,” was granted the liberty not to be punished by whipping “unless his crime be very shameful, and his course of life vicious and profligate.” Other men had a lesser liberty, not to be whipped more than forty stripes. Other liberties were assigned not to individuals at all, but to churches and towns and other social groups.9
                        - 
                    - Soul Liberty
                        - a.k.a. “Christian liberty,”: freedom to serve God in the world. It was freedom to order one’s own acts in a godly way—but not in any other. It made Christian freedom into a form of obligation.
                    - Freedom from the Tyranny of Circumstance:
                        - “Freedom” to describe a collective obligation of the “body politicke,” to protect individual members from the tyranny of circumstance. This was conceived not in terms of collective welfare or social equality but of individual liberty.
                - [Virginia Freedom Ways: The Anglican Idea of Hegemonic Liberty](https://erenow.net/common/fourbritishfolkwaysinamerica1989/67.php)
                    - Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege.
                    - "It never occurred to most Virginia gentlemen that liberty belonged to everyone. It was thought to be the special birthright of free-born Englishmen—a property which set this “happy breed” apart from other mortals, and gave them a right to rule less fortunate people in the world. Even within their own society, hegemonic liberty was a hierarchical idea. One’s status in Virginia was defined by the liberties that one possessed. Men of high estate were thought to have more liberties than others of lesser rank. Servants possessed few liberties, and slaves none at all. This libertarian idea had nothing to do with equality."
                    - Other open concepts: dominion over self (being a gentleman); social independence (more and more according to rank)
                - [Delaware Freedom Ways: The Quaker Idea of Reciprocal Liberty](https://erenow.net/common/fourbritishfolkwaysinamerica1989/102.php)
                    - Quaker persecution deeply impacted their protections for others.
                    - "In the conservative cast of their libertarian thinking, the Quakers were much the same as Puritans and Anglicans. But in the substance of their libertarian thought they were very different. In respect to liberty of conscience, trial by jury, the rights of property, the rule of representation, and race slavery, Quakers genuinely believed that every liberty demanded for oneself should also be extended to others." 
                    - Quakers believed in an idea of reciprocal liberty that embraced all humanity, and was written in the golden rule. [...] This Christian idea was reinforced in Quaker thinking by an exceptionally strong sense of English liberties. As early as 1687, William Penn ordered the full text of the Magna Carta to be reprinted in Philadelphia, together with a broad selection of other constitutional documents. His purpose was to remind the freeholders of Pennsylvania to remember their British birthright.
                    - A more contemporary (if only Christian) Freedom of Religion: The most important of these differences had to do with religious freedom—“liberty of conscience,” William Penn called it. This was not the conventional Protestant idea of liberty to do only that which is right. The Quakers believed that liberty of conscience extended even to ideas that they believed to be wrong. Their idea of “soul freedom” protected every Christian conscience.The most important of these differences had to do with religious freedom—“liberty of conscience,” William Penn called it.

                - [Backcountry Freedom Ways: The Border Idea of Natural Liberty](https://erenow.net/common/fourbritishfolkwaysinamerica1989/137.php)
                    - Tending towards a more liberatarian conception. Low taxes, minimal government, armed resistance to authority, and "elbow room" to live. 
                    - NOT reciprocal, no recognized right of dissent or disagreement. "Deviance from cultural norms was rarely tolerated; opposition was suppressed by force."
                    - "The backcountry idea of natural liberty was created by a complex interaction between the American environment and a European folk culture. It derived in large part from the British border country, where anarchic violence had long been a condition of life. The natural liberty of the borderers was an idea at once more radically libertarian, more strenuously hostile to ordering institutions than were the other cultures of British America."
                - A summary of the corrupted and expansive forms of the four prominent American Freedom Ways:
                    - “Considered in ethical terms, each of these four freedom ways began as a great and noble impulse, but all at first were limited in expression and defective in their operation. The Puritan idea of ordered freedom was no sooner brought to Massachusetts than it became an instrument of savage persecution. The cavalier conception of hegemonic freedom, when carried to Virginia, permitted and even required the growth of race slavery for its support. The Quaker vision of reciprocal freedom was a sectarian impulse which could be sustained only by withdrawal from the world. The backcountry belief in natural freedom sometimes dissolved into cultural anarchy.
                    - But each of these four libertarian traditions proved capable of continuing growth. New England’s Puritan faith in ordered freedom grew far beyond its original limits to become, in Perry Miller’s words, “a constellation of ideas basic to any comprehension of the American mind.” Virginia’s cavalier conceit of hegemonic freedom transcended its association with inequalities of rank and race and gender to become an ethical idea that is relevant to all. Pennsylvania’s Quaker inspiration of reciprocal freedom developed from a fragile sectarian vision into a libertarian creed remarkable for toughness of mind and tenacity of purpose. Border and backcountry notions of natural freedom evolved from a folk tradition into an elaborate ideology."
                    - "Each of these four freedom ways still preserves its separate existence in the United States. The most important fact about American liberty is that it has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even contrary traditions in creative tension with one another. This diversity of libertarian ideas has created a culture of freedom which is more open and expansive than any unitary tradition alone could possibly be. It has also become the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society in the United States. In time, this plurality of freedoms may prove to be that nation’s most enduring legacy to the world."
        - Cultural Transmission and Evolution according to Albion's Seed
            - **Mechanisms of Cultural Transmission/Persistence**: 
                - "Cultural persistence is not the same as stasis. Many things must happen if a culture is to be transmitted from one generation to the next." By what machinery does a culture persist?:
                    - Socialization/Enculturation: People learn their social roles within the culture
                    - Functional interdependence of institutional structures: Changing a culture means changing many things at once, which is difficult. Material and ethical structures tend to be mutually reinforcing.
                    - Elite Solidarity & Intergroup bargaining: Cultural elites consciously manage institutions according to their understanding, values, and self-interest
                    - Physical Force
            - **Change in Folkways Over Time: **
                - The Conclusion section applies the folkways across time in micro-chapters. I'm curious about what folkways (or if alien folkways to the British-American DNA) are playing major influences in 2040s America.
                    - Old Folkways and New Immigration (1900s-1930s) 
                        - "As late as 1900 nearly 60 percent of Americans had been of British stock. The old English-speaking cultures still firmly maintained their hegemony in the United States."
                        - "By 1920 the proportion of Americans with British ancestry had fallen to 41 percent. Still, three-quarters of the nation came from northwestern Europe, but other ethnic stocks from eastern and southern Europe were growing at a formidable rate."
                        - "As always when threatened from abroad, the four Anglo-Saxon cultures joined together in the 1920s to restrict the flow of the new immigration.[...] the immigration restriction bill of 1921 passed the Senate by a margin of 78 to 1. The House of Representatives approved it in a few hours without even bothering to take a roll call"
                        - Despite this "By 1980, the proportion of the American population who reported having any British ancestors at all had fallen below 20 percent. [...] The largest ethnic stock in the United States was [...] German."
                        - "The new immigrants [...] tended to adopt the folkways of the regions in which they settled. This was [e]specially the case among immigrant elites." Examples: Irish-Catholic New Englander JFK; Jewish borderlander Barry Goldwater; Black power cavalier Walter Fauntroy
                        - Large immigrant groups "Black culture throughout the United States tended generally to be an amalgam of African and southern folkways. Hispanic Americans in Texas and southern California combined the legacy of Latin America with the culture of the backcountry. Irish, Italian, Greek and French Canadian immigrants in Massachusetts all joined their special ethnic heritage to the customs of New England. The Germans and Scandinavians who settled the middle west learned the folkways which had spread outward from the Delaware Valley. Similar patterns of regional acculturation appeared in most major American ethnic groups."
                    - Examples of other cultures (olde but less influential folkways)
                        - New Netherlanders, who founded what would become New York City: "This culture developed its own special ways of dealing with other ethnic groups. It combined formal toleration, social distance and inequality in high degree. The result was an ethnic pluralism that became more atomistic than in the Delaware Valley and more hierarchical than in New England. The peculiar texture of life in New York City today still preserves qualities which existed in seventeenth-century New Amsterdam—and Old Amsterdam as well"
                        - West Indian families settled South Carolina early, speaking a gullah-influenced speech, high urbanization rates and Caribbean-European mashed architecture
                        - Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots who settled in Cape Fear NC after some old world rebellions. 
                    - America's new mental maps, 1980s onwards
                        - “By 1988, the original four regions of British America had greatly expanded, and were also joined by other regional cultures which did not exist two centuries earlier. Altogether, there were now at least seven cultural regions in the continental United States:”
                        - 1. "The Northern Tier, including New England, the upper old northwest, the northern plains and the Pacific northwest, all settled by Yankees but now dominated by other ethnic groups who are Roman Catholic in New England, Lutheran in the middle west."
                        - 2. "Greater New York, small in area but 10 percent of the national population, and a very heavy infusion of middle European and Jewish culture grafted on the old Dutch root."
                        - 3. "Midland America, extending from Pennsylvania west through the Ohio Valley and the middle west to the Rocky Mountains, marked by a diversity of European immigrant groups; the leading religion in many midland counties is Methodist."
                        - 4. "The Great Basin, a predominantly Mormon culture in Utah, and parts of Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming; a mix of New England, midland and highland southern culture."
                        - 5. "The Coastal South, from southern Maryland to Florida and the Texas coast near Houston. Its culture is tempered by large numbers of northern immigrants."
                        - 6. "The Southern Highlands, including Appalachia, the old southwest, the Ozark Plateau, and much of Texas and Oklahoma which are still dominated by the old ethnic groups; the leading religion is Baptist."
                        - 7. "Southern California, a hybrid of highland southern, midland, Hispanic and Jewish culture, spreading into Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico."
            - **Which folkway informs California the most?** 
                - Albion's Seed talks of California as receiving influences (specifically in the Borderland chapter) but not being generative by itself. (I'm willing to look past French and Spanish North America on the idea that the Four Folkways are the 20% of starter culture pack informs ~80% of foundational cultural influence.)
                - My thoughts: "From Counterculture to Cyberculture" paints a tension between Puritanical & Borderland influences. Fischer himself emphasizes the Turner-esque frontier spirit of the southern folks. (By contrast, German immigrants in the Puritan/Quaker spirit settle the northern midwest, cattle-rustling and very little native fighting by contrast).
            - **Back-of-napkin: US demographic profile 2040**
                - 2040 Demographics (just [Axios](https://www.axios.com/being-30-in-2040-future-new-world-us-diversity-2d3ba6db-3345-4ec4-97a8-9282fe1cee67.html), looking for fodder): 
                    - Large influx of hispanic immigrants lead to white minority w/in 5 years. 
                    - 1 in 4 Americans are irreligious. 
                    - Blisteringly overwhelmingly urban (est. 87%). 
                    - 1 in 5 over 65 y/o (born before 1975). 
                - [2040 Largest States:](https://www.statista.com/statistics/312714/us-projected-state-population-by-state/) California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois
                - Prominent non-English Folkway incursion: Hispanic-Americans with a Catholic background & comparatively somewhat Quaker-ish disposition
                    - America becomes 1/4 hispanic; Hispanics are 60% Catholic. Different cultural tradition, presumably mostly to the states we expect to be largest (California, Texas, Florida)
                    - Hispanic-Americans may not see themselves as a coherent voting bloc, but their inclusion in the USA's ways of speaking, thinking, and practicing politics is significant enough for me to try to feel out an angle. They don't seem to be very interested in minarchism, instead adhering to what this [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19906/) calls the "Immigrant-Settlement Agenda"- education, social services, transportation, public safety, discrimination. Anti-abortion trend but generally left-of-center addition to:
                        - California (order freedom + natural freedom)
                        - Texas + Florida (hierarchical + natural, but with cooling influence from northern migrants to cities), 
                        - New York (Dutch New Netherlander trader/hierarchists + order freedom + reciprocal freedom)
    - Tech Assumptions 2040
