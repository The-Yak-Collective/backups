- I run the Public Service Transformation Academy - www.publicservicetransformation.org - a not-for-profit social enterprise to support public service capability for transformation 
- We are beginning a learning community to 'build back better in the days after' the coronacrisis - https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2020/04/the-days-after-a-learning-community-to-build-back-better/
- The idea would be for a group to respond to learning/outputs from that group
- NB the definition of 'public service' â‰  'public sector' - we are talking about 'anyone directly involved in the creation of citizen and community outcomes'
