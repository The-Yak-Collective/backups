- Zis is the Z1 prototype page, where the main focus is brainy & generic software for rovers. In scope:
    - Off-the-shelf hardware, and most likely other Yaks.
    - Software "brain" for rovers, configurable or automatically adaptable to the actual hardware.
    - Remote control, debugging, telemetry/monitoring.
    - [[Maier Fenster]] i think it will need more sophisticated gaits
- Current Activity
    - Hardware: HiWonder SpiderPi
    - Images: https://postimg.cc/gallery/FQZ0cgT
    - Measurements for reference (WIP)
        - Metrics on "force": Apparently powerful servos (20Kg/cm2). Measurements t understand what that translates to in terms of lift, power on each leg relative to others, etc.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] i would ask - can it climb a rob by hugging it?
        - Generic metrics like speed, etc.
        - Temperature mapping using sensors and the Pi internal data: Useful when considering building water-proof clothing, etc.
        - Linear speed, turn speed.
    - Possible features
        - RT video stream from the camera (and other sensors?)
        - ability to select or upload (via github?) a code to be executed by robot and view the effect in RT, including video and servo positions
for now, i am thinking re delegate, that you have code on the robot and code on the server. one or both may need help. for video, why not stream using twilio?

        - A SpiderPi is online, yet through SSH and manual work for now. The battery problem remains, but I have found a simple solution by tracking custom system services and turning them off. Now a "minimal" stack, with just what is needed to run the code. And just this allowed completing system updates without depleting the battery.
            - [[Maier Fenster]] can you share what services to stop? do you have a shell command for it?
        - As for @Maier (U+2)#6756 suggestion turning off the servos, that did not work. After some search, I found the standard document linked above is superseded by one for the bot series (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b3v81sb9nwir16q/AACkK-tg0q39fKJZcSl-YrqOa/LX-16A%20Bus%20Servo?dl=0&preview=LewanSoul+Bus+Servo+Communication+Protocol.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1), and the command to turn off servos succeed by does nothing apparently. Code available if someone is interested.
        - The battery problem remains and may kill the bot for a reboot anytime if "pushed too much". For now trying to push toward the intended goal to remote control/remote install code, while looking a ways to deal with battery (i.e. learning the platform).
