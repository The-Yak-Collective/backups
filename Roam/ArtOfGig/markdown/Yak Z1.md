- Zis is the Z1 prototype page, where the main focus is brainy & generic software for rovers. In scope:
    - Off-the-shelf hardware, and most likely other Yaks.
    - Software "brain" for rovers, configurable or automatically adaptable to the actual hardware.
    - Remote control, debugging, telemetry/monitoring.
- Current Activity
    - Hardware: HiWonder SpiderPi

    - Measurements for reference (WIP)
        - Metrics on "force": Apparently powerful servos (20Kg/cm2). Measurements t understand what that translates to in terms of lift, power on each leg relative to others, etc.
        - Generic metrics like speed, etc.
        - Temperature mapping using sensors and the Pi internal data: Useful when considering building water-proof clothing, etc.
        - Linear speed, turn speed.
