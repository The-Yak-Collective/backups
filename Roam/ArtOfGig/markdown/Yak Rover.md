- A project to design a real Mars rover prototype that can actually be built and trialled on Earth, and evolved into a production model that could potentially even be launched to Mars.
- Project lead: [[Venkatesh Rao]]: In another life I was an aerospace engineer, and my phd/postdoc were all related to space stuff, ground robots etc. My own relevant research was on mapping and path planning, and I probably know enough to do the basic mechanical and control design for a rover. What I'd need support on is electronics design, software, etc.
- Phase 1: [[Yak One Design Sketchbook]]: A Da Vinci style notebook of sketches by March 31
- Phase 2: Top down detail design with subsystem dependecies consensus. Output is specs for rover by June 30
- Phase 3: All subsystem designs for collective review by sept 30-output is set of subsystem design docs
- Phase 4: Integrated system design docs by Dec 31. These should be enough to at least get started on actually building a rover, even if some details are TBD due to testing/experimental needs.
- Roles needed
    - Electronics design (RPi, Arduino, special chips/boards, sensor/actuator circuitry)
    - Procurement (somebody to centrally buy and ship stuff to people who need hardware to work with)
    - Software architect
- The initial prototype will be a small (think toy-scale but not a toy) rover that could be built from 3d printed parts and controlled by an RPi or similar, with fairly minimal payload etc.
- If we pull this off, it will be the first milestone of the [[YC Space Program]]
- Budget/funding: I think we can do all the design using free/open source tools. Fabricating a prototype (a stretch goal) would likely cost $1000 or so. I (Venkat) will commit to funding a minimum viable prototype if we get the design that far along. So basic electronics/electrical components, fabrication of the chassis and other mechanical elements, paying for basic accounts (for Starlink for eg)
- Missions
    - Inspection
    - Troubleshooting
    - Survey
    - Sample collection
    - Self-inspection
    - Self-repair
- Tests
    - Mobility
        - Climb a 45 degree gradient
        - Climb a 30mm high step
        - Clear obstacles 50mmX50mmX50mm under chassis
        - 45 degree roll without toppling
    - Physical robustness
        - Can survive 1m drop without damage
        - Can survive falling objects up to 50 grams
    - Power
        - Last 1 hour at full power in the dark
        - Last 6 months in minimal power draw hibernation
    - Electronics
        - Can survive failure of any single component ((2x redundancy full)
- Rover One rough design
    - Chassis
        - Fits in a 60cm x 30 cm x 20 cm cuboid
        - 3-wheel tricycle with solar panels
        - Main chasis will be an alumimum perf board with flexible capacity for holding stuff
    - Drivetrain
        - 2 independent drive motors for the rear wheels, steering via third wheel
    - Power subsystem
        - Solar panels
        - LiIon battery pack
    - Sensors
        - "Whisker" based proximal obstacle sensing
        - LIDAR?
        - Radar (can we get cheap enough?)
        - Drive cameras
    - Navigation and control
        - GPS
        - SLAM style local navigation
        - Stored map for deployment zone
    - Communications
        - Starlink WiFi
        - Continuous telemetry of system healthy
    - Payload
        - Gimballed surveying camera (dual use for self inspection)
        - Maybe some sort of atmosphere sensor, like pollution?
    - Compute
        - RPi for general compute (2x redudant maybe?)
        - Might need a couple of Arduinos for microcontroller needs and also fallback basic behaviors mode if the compute or comms fail
    - Software stack
        - System health and diagnostics
        - Comms
        - Failure mode id and recovery/reconfig
        - Basic path planning and navigation
        - API-controlled payload ops
        - etc.
