- YakCon One ([[January 8th, 2023]] to [[January 15th, 2023]])
    - Retro notes, perspectives etc.
        - From [[Venkatesh Rao]]:
            - General reaction to YakCon: the format has legs. Clearly the async part needs better programming models but overall I think the idea of an event as simply regular scheduled programming turned up to 11 is worth exploring further. Just an up-tempo regime. Natural for a highly tempo-aware group like this. Most trad orgs have a fixed tempo, and do events as off-tempo breaks. Thereâ€™s a sense of a retreat or mood change. I never thought to examine that assumption that events have to be a break from the routine. When the routine itself is a delicate equilibrium between voluntary motivation and friction, up-tempo is an event by itself. Other things that fit the model: homecoming week, military surges in war zones etc. Basically take the seasonality metaphor seriously.  The weather doesnâ€™t have designed special days, but does have tempo variations and exceptional days. Another way to think of an up-tempo week is like a one-rep max in weight training. Youâ€™re not always testing yourself by pushing past 100%, but sometimes you do. Most times youâ€™re at 70%.
        - From [[Matthew Sweet]]
            - The general format (two sessions of intro > speaker(s) > all-hands > breakouts spanned by a week) worked really well.
            - A decent amount of interest was gathered for Part One, but a big drop off during Async Week and coming into Part Two was really evident. I think this is fine, though. The aim with this format, from a promo / awareness perspective, should be to:
                - Maximising interest prior to Part One and converting, then...
                - Achieving high continuity with the engaged group from Part One, through Async Week and into Part Two
            - The promo and continuity can be achieved in part through a bit more advance planning around promotion and posts, as well as upgrading Async Week activities a little more. Onboarding and orientating people in the Discord did seem to be a sticking point, too.
            - On the speaker front, a longer on-ramp for finding, pitching and confirming guests speakers would be really helpful. However, I still think the short format plus quick Q&A works well for the speaker and the attendees. And it isn't the hardest sell in the world, either, as YC is a pretty diverse, high engagement bunch when it comes to it.
            - Tooling-wise, [[Luma]] was really good for event management, and I think [[Whereby]] was slick, too. Personally, I'm no Zoom fan and G.Meet isn't really designed for events. Teams is... ugh.
            - On future events
                - For YC as a whole
                    - Think it makes sense to go to a higher tempo than annual and to diverge more strongly from established rhythms and practices. Quarterly feels too short of a cycle, though. Perhaps something aligned around the solstices/shortest and longest days of the year would be fun.
                - For individual activity tracks/streams
                    - The kernel of the format could also be used to catalyse synthesis activities, like those that occur at the end of a season (e.g. the gov. studies primer). Not on a defined cycle, but at timely moments.
                    - A pared down version of Part One and Twoâ€”perhaps half the length but with speakers, an all-hands and a breakout / interactive segment focused exclusively on a given trackâ€”plus an Async Week could easily be moulded to fit around a desired track/activity-specific outcome.

                    - gist/gestalt
                        - The core of YC is synchronous study, collab and tinkering sessions with async research and comms. Both occur at an easy, sustainable tempo with an infinite game outlook.
                        - YakCon reflects this. It's a week-long interactive tinkering session.
                    - sign-up link
                        - YakCon isn't a broadcast. It's not your typical AGM. It's a participatory open house. Come by and check it out.

                - Draft
                    - YakCon nears.
                    - It's a week-long interactive tinkering session hosted by the Yak Collective, with two virtual meetups (on Sunday 8th and 15th Jan) joined by a week of asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord.
                    - You can register for it here:Â https://lu.ma/yakcon
                    - (And you probably should; it's approaching max viable capacity)
                    - Or you can stick around and learn more about what YakCon Part One, YakCon Part Two and the spanning Async Week actually involve...
                    - The plan for YakCon Part One and Two?
                    - Both sessions will begin with a quick introduction to the Yak Collective and either a quick review of 2022 (Part One) or a quick preview of 2023 (Part Two). This will be followed by our guest speakers.
                    - In Part One, Killian Butler will give us some insight into productising machine learning research.
                    - He knows a little (actually, a lot) about this; he's Head of Product at Papercup. They're working on rapid, automated dubbing that preserves the expressivity of the original content.
                    - In Part Two, we'll be hearing from Mike Casey and Dan Grover.
                    - Mike will be tackling a difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?" 
                    - He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity â€” whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences).
                    - Danâ€”designer, engineer, entrepreneurâ€”will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.
                    - Once the speakers have spoke (and fielded some challenging questions), we can get into the actual activities of YC. The infinite games currently being played by us.
                    - We'll take a brief tour through:
                        - Rover building and distributed systems studies
                        - The Fermi Gym
                        - Governance studies
                        - Infrastructure activities
                        - YC's pop-up consulting projects
                        - [[YakFit-ðŸ’ª]]
                    - Some other nascent activities will probably get a namedrop, too.
                    - In Part One, this round robin will be more focused on recent activity. In Part Two, there'll be a little more focus on upcoming activities and possibilities.
                    - With the all-hands ticked off, the breakouts begin.
                    - In these, you'll be able to participate in a session based on some recurring YC activities:
                        - The Fermi Gym OR robotics and distributed systems studies (Breakout A)
                        - Infrastructure OR governance studies (Breakout B)
                    - Breakouts in Part One will lay the groundwork for things taking place during Async Week. "Async Week" is a fancy name for asynchronous activities (curated by volunteer track leads) on our Discord. Breakouts in Part Two will bring together the efforts from Part One and Async Week.
                    - The end of the breakout sessions marks the end of the event for the day. To close, there may be a few comments, some questions or even a discussion.
                    - And we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a secret afterparty.

                    - YakCon Part One is done. We had around thirty participants (+/- 5) for the full four hour session. There was a mixture of active and inactive Yaks, as well as some newcomers; approx. 40% of attendees were new to YC or returning from a hiatus.
                    - Far from being a snooze fest, the consensus is that YakCon whizzed by. Here's a recap that may indicate why.
                    - Killian Butler ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/kilianbutler),Â [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kilianbutler)) kicked us off with an engaging talk around the theme of productising machine learning research. "Is model failure indicative of product failure?" "Where does margin accrue in the AGI supply chain?" These questions (and more) were explored.
                    - We then took a whirlwind tour of sustained YC activity areasâ€”such as governance and distributed system studies, infrastructure and the Fermi Gymâ€”as well as an overview of YC's emerging pop-up consulting methodology.
                    - Following the all-hands, we had one breakout session that allowed participants to:
                        - Enter the Fermi Gym and attempt a roughly-right answer to a sensor-focused problem
                        - Orient themselves in the terrain of distributed robotics via a pebble automata puzzle
                    - The second breakout session was a little lighter. Participants were able to:
                        - Read an essay on rules and discuss their common invocations (as models, as algorithms, as laws)
                        - Receive an introduction to YC's infrastructure and ideate opportunities for expansion, improvement and experimentation
                    - Thus passed the hours.
                    - Now, we're into YakCon's Async Week. Below is a breakdown of what's happening.
                    - ## Async Week Activities
                        - ### Distributed systems and robotics
                            - Monday 9th Jan, 1600 UTC: the regular distributed systems reading group (focused on cache coherence, a gnarly computer science issue).
                            - Tuesday 10th Jan, 2000 UTC: the regular robotics group, this week involving a demo and discussion of SLAM navigation in the Unity game engine.
                            - Every day: a new item will be selected from the accrued reading list, as well as arbitrary Discord chatter.
                        - ### Governance studies
                            - Friday 15th Jan, 1700 UTC, the regular governance studies session which will involve a rules-focused reading and dialogue.
                            - Throughout the week: informal chatter and link-drops in the Discord.
                        - ### The Fermi Gym
                            - Throughout the week: self-paced answering of some Fermi Gym questions (an easy, medium and hard option available) alongside informal discussion and analysis.
                        - ### Infrastructure
                            - Throughout the week: a self-paced ideation session focused on the evolving YC infrastructure (which can span design, UX etc. as well as code).
                            - Thursday 14th Jan: a potential pop-up sync session based on activity and discussion.
                        - ### YakFit
                            - Throughout the week: a self-paced, health/fitness-focused, week-long experiment (options include lux exposure, a supplement trial and slooooow movement).
                        - â€‹You'll need access to the YC Discord to take part in any of the above. GoÂ [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html)Â to get it.
                    - ## Towards YakCon Part Two
                        - After Async Week, we get to YakCon Part Two.
                        - It follows the same structure as Part One (and it's at the same time; 1600 UTC this coming Sunday), and it will be friendly to those who missed Part One and/or Async Week. We'll have two guest speakers for this session, though.
                        - We'll be hearing from Mike Casey ([Farcaster](http://fcast.me/mc),Â [personal site](https://mcasey.xyz/)). He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity â€” whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences). He'll be tackling the difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?"
                        - We'll also be hearing from Dan Grover ([personal site](http://dangrover.com/),Â [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangrover/)). Danâ€”designer, engineer, entrepreneurâ€”will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.
                        - Sounds good, right? So get to it. Register for YakCon Part Two [here](https://lu.ma/yakcon) and go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to access to the YC Discord.
            - {{[[DONE]]}} [[January 14th, 2023]]: booster for part two

                    - Part One and Async Week make up two thirds of YakCon, our week-long interactive tinkering session. Tomorrow's Part Two (1600-2000 UTC) concludes the event.
                    - For Part One we had around thirty participants (+/- 5) for the full session, inc. a mixture of active and inactive Yaks and newcomers. General consensus: everyone enjoyed themselves.
                    - The talk that Kilian Butler gave to kick the session off was focused on productising machine learning research. You can check it out on our YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl1-zt0zQ28
                    - Thenâ€”after whirlwind tours of YC activity in 2022â€”we got into two rounds of breakouts.
                    - The first breakout gave participants two choices:
                        - Enter the Fermi Gym and attempt a roughly-right answer to a sensor-focused problem
                        - Orient themselves in the terrain of distributed robotics via a pebble automata puzzle
                    - The second breakout gave participants another choice:
                        - Read an essay on rules and discuss their common invocations (as models, as algorithms, as laws)
                        - Receive an introduction to YC's infrastructure and ideate opportunities for expansion, improvement and experimentation
                    - Spanning the gap between last week's Part One and tomorrow's Part Two was Async Week, which saw a smattering of activity on the YC Discord. This included reading drops, the regular recurring sync sessions and dialogues in different channels.
                    - Part Two will utilise the same essential structure as Part One:
                        - Guest speakers
                        - All-hands intro to YC and 2023 activity previews
                        - Two rounds of breakouts (Fermi Gym or distributed robotics; governance or infrastructure)
                    - The difference will be in our guest speakers. For Part Two we have, rather appropriately, two speakers.
                    - Mike Casey ([Farcaster](http://fcast.me/mc),Â [personal site](https://mcasey.xyz/)) will be tackling the difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?"
                    - Mike specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity â€” whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences). It's an interesting playspace to be in.
                    - For example, in [this piece](https://porticoadvisers.com/2022/09/14/four-dynamics/) Mike highlighted four dynamics shaping global private markets today:
                        - Primary fundraising is extremely challenging
                        - Consolidation is transforming the strategic landscape
                        - The difficult macro environment is necessitating novel liquidity solutions
                        - Crypto is emerging as an institutional asset class
                    - Mike'll be providing some insight into how these dynamicsâ€”and othersâ€”are unfolding and the impact they're having.
                    - Our second speaker is Dan Grover ([personal site](http://dangrover.com/),Â [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangrover/)). Danâ€”designer, engineer, entrepreneurâ€”will be expanding upon and contextualising his essay, [Simulation Games Might Be What The World Needs Now](http://dangrover.com/blog/2022/09/24/sim-games.html).
                    - Spoiler alert, but my favourite snippet from this piece is as follows:
                        - "Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke argues a similar point]Â â€“ positing that games like Factorio teach transferrable skills for dealing with complex strategic tradeoffs that arenâ€™t taught in business books. Itâ€™s difficult at first to imagine this at first with a game like Factorio in particular. After all, it doesnâ€™t even come close to simulating reality â€“ its object is to build and streamline a factory on a hostile alien planet whose purpose seems, perversely, to be to produce the materials needed to further expand the factory.
                        - But even the most unrealistic sim games speak directly to this ever-present, essential, structural truth to the reality we inhabit. These games reenforce that the world is always more complicated than it looks. They teach us that the laws governing the material outcomes we live with donâ€™t care at all about our virtue or intentions â€“ that the Covid virus doesnâ€™t care whether you trust Tony Fauci and the supply chain doesnâ€™t care whether youâ€™d prefer the items you purchase be made in your own country. And most importantly, they teach us how to model, analyze, and problem-solve in the face of such a complex, cruel, and indifferent world and ignore hucksters offering us easy remedies."
                    - And that's just the speakers.
                    - YakCon Part Two is shaping up to be as fun as Part One. Come and join the party. Register for Part Two [here](https://lu.ma/yakcon) and go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to access to the YC Discord.
