    - Ethereum Foundation runs 6-8 week protocol development study track
    - Proposal to run a slower-paced version focusing on protocol development
    - Goal to potentially contribute to the Ethereum Wiki
    - Links to Wiki and study materials shared
- ### Learning Structure Agreement
    - Will use 15-20 minutes for reading during sessions
    - Participants will review and discuss materials
    - Will use Granola to generate summaries of lecture content
    - Baseline expectation: Review slides + text summary before meetings
- ### Content Format Discussion
    - Each lecture includes:
        - 90-minute video lecture
        - Accompanying slides
        - Wiki pages
        - Technical deep dives
        - Background philosophy articles
    - Granola summaries prove efficient - compress 90-min lectures into 20-min readable content
- ### Learning Materials Approach
    - First weekâ€™s Granola summary is concise and manageable
    - Participants will focus on:
        - Granola-generated lecture summaries
        - Slide deck review
        - Linked articles based on interest
        - Technical and philosophical background materials
