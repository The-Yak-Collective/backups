        - {{[[TODO]]}} review: revised YakMap signup form no login: 
          https://yak.knack.com/yaks#yakmap-participation-signup/
            - notes
                - if we do it this way, will have to manually map all submissions to the Yak's Discord UID VS the form that is behind a login and triggered by a clever Discord bot with profiled UID
                - alt form » https://yak.knack.com/yaks#yak-profile/
                - pull in a Discord bot team member
                    - need a bot that listens to new Yak on Discord
