                    - [[Foundations - Positioning]]

                    - [[Showcase Projects Launch]]
                      how do we launch showcase projects to maximize target visibility and engagement
                    - [[Marketing Channels]]
                      where and how do we communicate and engage with the target audience
                - We also considered if we should devote our efforts to Yaks vs. Clients
                - We didn't progress enough on any stream
                    - Foundations - there's a multitude of perspectives - we may let emerge - what we are is what we do
                    - Project Launches - YC collective energy is on the building - either we want to build to achieve a business goal - attract a specific audience - or any launch lacks the basic goals and targets.
                    - We also realize that Launch potential is also missing marketing channels - YC collective audience is still very small and probably more on the indie side than on the client side.
