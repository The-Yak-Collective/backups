        - Filling the Packaging Sustainability Void in Healthcare Product Distribution
    - ### Solution Summary
        - Our solution is to provide sustainable product distribution packaging that global biotech organisation's can use to distribute goods to centralised healthcare providers.
        - The current product distribution packaging approach is costly, wasteful, and unaligned with both product design sophistication and the explicit sustainability initiatives invoked by all parties.
        - For example, in 2014, a single hospital department produced [100 tonnes](https://map.sustainablehealthcare.org.uk/newcastle-upon-tyne-hospitals-nhs-foundation-trust/baling-and-recycling-bottles-cardboard) of cardboard waste, much derived from product packaging. In 2021/22, the entire NHS spent [£152 million to manage 400,000+ tonnes of waste](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/estates-returns-information-collection/england-2021-22).
        - Large organisations and key stakeholders in this space are launching ambitious sustainability initiatives (e.g. the [NHS](https://www.supplychain.nhs.uk/sustainability/)) and are becoming increasingly conscious of their sustainability stances (e.g. [Roche](https://www.roche.com/stories/efficiency-meets-ecology-in-evergreener)).
        - Pharmaceutical and healthcare product distribution is an established, high-value, high-criticality market. The pharma product packaging market more generally is estimated at 99.9 billion USD for 2021 and 196.8 billion USD in 2026 (14.5% CAGR). Alongside the continuous product movement, the discrete use cases that simplify entry and expansion, and the absence of a need to engineer or incentivise new behaviours, we believe healthcare is an ideal market for Ocean Six to enter.
        - We have identified an entry case via contact with NHS Biomedical Scientist: the recurring provision of immunocytochemistry (ICC) antibody and reagent kits. These are supplied by Roche and distributed via DHL to a medium-sized NHS trust in the south west of the UK.
        - Ocean Six's reusable box can be swapped for current one-time use product distribution packaging and used to create the following benefits for NHS trusts and Roche, respectively:
            - Roche’s total distribution costs are lowered (a lighter, smaller box)
            - Roche’s distribution packaging aligns with sustainable product design
            - Roche/NHS benefit from enhanced product protection and QA
            - Roche/NHS packaging processing time, energy and cost is reduced
        - Currently, 10-30 individually boxed kits are delivered in a larger cardboard box (est. 60% space utilisation) filled with buffer materials. Kits are ordered monthly, have a value up to £1,000 each, and are invalid if they exceed the 8-30 degrees cels. range.
        - This process is unsustainable, causes considerable expense of time, effort and energy within the involved NHS trust, and offers minimal product protection and QA during distribution.
        - The specific modifications we propose in tandem with this entry case are as follows:
            - One larger and one smaller, product-specific box
            - Integrated exterior document sleeve
            - Inserts for item / inner package stabilisation
            - Inserts for item / inner package segregation
            - Exterior attachment points for connecting to carrier systems
        - These complement the already-proposed designs that are applicable to this use case and sector:
            - A collapsible design with small footprint
            - Construction that contributes to ambient temperature control
            - Materials that can be cleaned and sterilised easily and repetitively
            - Leak-proof and secure box closure mechanism
        - The reusable plastic boxes that Ocean Six produces can guarantee temperature stability and maintain the physical integrity of the included materials. Their reusable boxes are more rigid and can be sealed and locked to ensure spill-proofing.
    - ### "Why Healthcare?" Value Statements of Varying Lengths
        - Unsustainable product distribution packaging
            - Short
                - Product distribution packaging is primitive and wasteful
            - Med
                - Current product distribution packaging is costly, wasteful and unaligned with both product design sophistication and the explicit sustainability initiatives invoked by all parties.
            - Long
                - The current state of product distribution packaging is costly, wasteful, and out-of-sync with both product design sophistication and the explicit sustainability initiatives involved parties profess to value.
                - Critical-level suppliers tote their sustainable, innovative practices and the NHS has national-level initiatives to control supply chain efficiency and waste. However, products are often transported to hospitals as small boxes in oversized large boxes, stuffed with waste filler material and sealed with one-use tapes.
        - High product value, volume and variety
            - Short
                - Healthcare products are high value, high volume and highly varied.
            - Med
                - Healthcare products span a great variety of services and include high value specialty items and high volume generic products.
            - Long
                - Healthcare involves a vast variety of high value specialised products and high volumes of generic items. These are in constant use at the largest possible scale, often involve tight production and operational constraints, and are sourced from a finite pool of approved partners.
        - An established ecosystem
            - Short
                - It's an ecosystem with established behaviour patterns and relationships
            - Med
                - It's an ecosystem with established behaviour patterns and relationships that doesn't require 0>1 innovation or the engineering of new behaviours.
            - Long
                - It's an ecosystem with established behaviour patterns and relationships that doesn't require 0>1 innovation or the engineering of new behaviours.
                - Within the ecosystem there are hospitals and healthcare service providers that are incredibly resource-sensitive, departments and teams relying on inefficient, labour-intensive workarounds, resource-rich suppliers that are incentivised to appear innovative and sustainable, and distributors that are (mostly) agnostic to packaging form factors and constraints.
        - Continuous product movement
            - Short
                - There are multiple vectors of continuous product movement.
            - Med
                - Products are in continuous motion, flowing between suppliers, healthcare service providers and interfacing third-parties.
            - Long
                - Products are in continuous motion, flowing in multiple directions at all times of the day and year. From suppliers to centralised hospital sites, from centralised sites to satellite locations, from department to department, and between various stores.
                - The products in motion touch numerous in-house and contracted service providers, suppliers and wholesalers, and distribution partners.
        - Discrete use cases
            - Short
                - Discrete use cases enable targeted market entry and expansion
            - Med
                - Diverse product categories, users and movements facilitate targeted market entry and expansion.
            - Long
                - Market entry and expansion cases can be conceived effectively by choosing from a range of characteristics. These include specific product lines and categories, select suppliers, service providers and partners, different teams, departments or functional areas, and certain vectors of product movement.
    - ### Alternate Entry/Expansion Cases
        - As part of our exploration, we also identified some alternative cases that could be used for market entry and/or expansion.
            - **Initiate a similar upgrade of circular clinical liquid management packaging materials**
                - There's an existing ecosystem built around the recurring supply, return and safe disposal of solvents, formalin and other hazardous liquids. And it shares similar deficiencies/opportunities with the ICC entry case identified above.
                - Solvents, formalin etc. cannot simply be poured away, so the liquids must be re-collected after use and returned to a supplier or disposer directly. Currently, this circularity is enabled by the re-use of previously appropriated and stored cardboard packaging.
                - Example organisations involved in this process include NHS trusts and suppliers such as [Genta Medical](https://www.gentamedical.co.uk).
            - **Target the packaging of another high value healthcare product**
                - The NHS receives a continual supply of cartridges for the [Biocartis Idylla](https://www.biocartis.com/en/meet-idylla/idylla-platform), a PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction) molecular testing platform.
                - The Idylla platform is in operation at a smaller number of NHS sites around the UK, and the product distribution process, again, shares similar deficiencies/opportunities with the ICC entry case identified above.
                - In this case, the Idylla cartridges supplied in typical cardboard boxes include a commodity temperature monitor that verifies whether the package has exceeded the manufacturer's required temperature thresholds.
            - **Provide reusable packaging for central stores within NHS site**
                - Currently, many central stores within hospitals rely on the collection, storage and re-use of cardboard packaging from various deliveries that arrive at a given hospital.
                - These are themselves stored inefficiently (and often, unsafely), used to house collections of different products for different services, and used to distribute items from central stores to the relevant teams and departments and back again. 
                - Iteratively replacing these re-used cardboard boxes would relieve many pains for those involved in the operation of central stores and the distribution of items around a site.
                - The NHS, however, is incredibly resource sensitive so there would be limited interest (and upside) in this use case.
                - Interestingly, though, if a certain allotment of reusable boxes from any of the above entry cases were allowed to enter into circulation for use by central stores (e.g. 5% of total supply), there would be an additional value-add realised by partners, customers, and the individuals that make up their staff.

    - Long Description
        - Our solution is to provide sustainable packaging for pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. The transport of pharmaceutical materials is a solved problem from a logistical perspective. But if you look at the problem from a sustainability perspective it becomes a huge mess (pun intended).
        - Just a single UK hospital produces 100 tonnes of cardboard waste a year. UK NHS as a whole produces around 600k tonnes of cardboard waste. Part of this cardboard is recycled, but the problem of collecting, managing, and transporting this waste uses a lot of public resources.
        - Current product distribution packaging is costly, wasteful, and unaligned with product design sophistication and the explicit sustainability initiatives invoked by all parties. The problem is not unnoticed. Roche has launched a huge sustainability effort lately and other big names are following. This is an excellent moment to get into the market.
        - Pharmaceutical and healthcare transport markets are established mature high-value markets. The pharma product packaging market is estimated at 99.9 billion USD for 2021 and 196.8 billion USD in 2026 (14.5% CAGR). Estimation is done by MarketsandMarkets research company. Behavior patterns and relationships are already established so there is no need to invent a market or to nudge into totally new practices. There are many stakeholders involved in the process and possibilities for market entry are enlarged by the publics increasing interest in climate change and sustainability. The government, the public, patients, environmental groups, and insurance companies all want to see healthcare and pharma more sustainable.
        - We are suggesting a reusable plastic box that is adjusted for the transport of pharmacological materials both in size and function.
        - We can take the provision of immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry (IHC/ICC) antibody and reagent kits from a global biotech org to a medium size NHS trust as an example. The current solution is to use cardboard boxes 40cmx60cmx40cm for transporting multiple kits. The kits themselves are packaged in smaller cardboard boxes (10cmx3cmx5cm or 10cmx20cmx5cm). There is an additional problem with size. Outer cardboard boxes are usually up to 60% bigger than they have to be and are supplemented with fillers (sawdust, paper…). All of this packaging is single-use and is thrown away after delivery.
        - Plastic boxes that Ocean Six produces can withstand temperature changes and maintain the temperature integrity of the materials. Another important fact is the physical integrity of the boxes. Cardboard boxes are soft and susceptible to degradation in humid conditions. Especially when they are half empty. Plastic boxes are more rigid and can be sealed and locked to ensure spill-proof and transport integrity.
        - Immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry (IHC/ICC) antibody and reagent kits are just one example of possible materials that can be transported with these boxes. Other materials can include the supply of cartridges for Biocartis Idylla, the PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction) molecular testing platform, recurring supply, return, and safe disposal of solvents, formalin, and other hazardous liquids.
        - In order to use the boxes in the pharma setting, we are proposing some modifications:
            - Standardised box dimensions that align with existing product sizes
            - An integrated document sleeve on the box’s exterior
            - Inserts for item / inner package stabilization
            - Inserts for item / inner package segregation
            - Collapsible design and small footprint for re-use, storage and return
            - Materials that are compatible with cleaning/sterilization processes
            - Leak-proof and secure sealing/closure mechanism
            - Attachment points for connecting to carrier systems (e.g. drones).
    - Initial presentation Qs
        - Views on the product?
            - The reusable box is close to a commodity; literal design seems like a red ocean. Better to focus on adoption in particular niches, applications and ecosystems.

                                    - Smaller reusable box appropriate to existing pack sizes that is suitable for on-site storage or dissemination / reuse elsewhere within the site
                                - Mods (beyond the generic mentioned above)
                                    - Fillable coolant walls on either/both reusable boxes
                                    - Insertion of commodity temp checker
                        - Movement / ecosystem
                            - Current
                                - Stock take performed by trust
                                - Products purchased from supplier by trust
                                - Supplier picks and packs products
                                - Products shipped via third-party distribution to trust
                                - Products received into storage and used by trust
                            - Proposed
                                - Stock take performed by trust
                                - Products purchased from supplier by trust
                                - Supplier picks and packs products in reusable boxes
                                - Products shipped via third-party distribution to trust
                                - Products received into storage and used by trust
                                - **Existing stock of smaller reusable boxes and larger, outer packaging returned to supplier**
                        - Problem(s) being solved
                            - Current cardboard packaging is oversized
                            - Current cardboard packaging is unsustainable/single-use
                            - Current cardboard packaging doesn't protect products
                            - Temps not guaranteed between supplier and arrival on site
                            - Hidden cost inefficiency
                                - Single-use, inefficiently sized cardboard packaging distributed 100 times likely costs more than nested reusable boxes (e.g. 1 large outer, 6-10 inner) being distributed and reused 100 times
                            - Aligning distribution / bulk packaging with product packaging practices
                                - e.g. this Roche article on reagent package design: https://www.roche.com/stories/efficiency-meets-ecology-in-evergreener
                - Other cases
                    - Target the packaging of a high value, site-supplier product line
                        - Supply of cartridges for Biocartis Idylla, the PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction) molecular testing platform
                            - https://www.biocartis.com/en/meet-idylla/idylla-platform
                    - Upgrade packaging of circular clinical liquid management process
                        - Recurring supply, return and safe disposal of solvents, formalin and other hazardous liquids

                    - Enhance packaging of central stores distributing items around a site
                        - Replacement of appropriated cardboard boxes from various deliveries to a site that are repurposed, stored and used to circulate items from central stores to relevant departments
        - Alt case investigation
            - Cold chain control and verification:
                - Involved parties:
                    - Wholesale/warehouse
                    - Transport
                    - Receiver:
                      hospital/pharmacy/reseller
                - Packaging design constraints / modifications
                    - Temperature sensor with memory – cold chain consistency check
                    - Lock/seal – integrity check
                    - Additional cooling pads/gels/insulation bags for lower temperatures (currently 2-3°c/ 4°c for 12-48 hours.)
                    - The mobile app combined with a QR code for administrative parts (input, output, signing…) App backend can be on blockchain to prevent retroactive tracking information changes. The blockchain part can sound like a gimmick, so we need to discuss it.
                - Movement/flow:
                    - Wholesale/warehouse: goods are packaged appropriately, the temperature sensor is started, the box is sealed/locked, the app scans the box QR code, the operator enters the data about the shipment, shipment is transferred to transportation
                    - Transportation: courier scans the QR code of the box, and carries it to the destination, and transport is done in the cold chamber.
                    - Receiver: the receiver scans the QR code of the box, unlocks/unseals the box, opens, reads the sensor data, confirms shipment in the app, and stores the goods appropriately. If there were inappropriate temperature swings, the shipment is compromised, flagged in the app, and sent back.
                    - Circular part: two options: one is that the box is sent back empty. The other that it is filled with medical waste, sealed, and sent for waste management, then cleaned and sent back.
            - Central stores for intra-site circulation of items:
                - Involved parties:
                    - Central warehouse
                    - Optional courier
                    - Receiver: hospital
                      ward/room
                - Packaging design constraints / modifications
                    - Additional inlays for easier transport of different things
                    - Spill-proofing
                    - The mobile app combined with a QR code for administrative parts (input, output, signing…)
                - Movement/flow:
                    - Warehouse: goods are packaged appropriately, the app scans the box QR code, the operator enters the output order, goods are taken by the receiver (who scans the QR code and accepts the input order) or optionally given to the courier
                    - Courier (optional): courier scans the QR code of the box, carries it to the destination
                    - Receiver: the receiver scans the QR code of the box, opens the box, confirms the input order, and stores the goods appropriately.
                    - Circular part: the receiver send/takes the box back to the warehouse to be ready for the next transfer. The other option is that the box is used as a medical locker within the hospital room.
