    - "For this whole cluster of folkways, the distinguishing factors are a) intimacy b) money being absent or secondary within the relationship. So a brain or connected set of brains is likely at its least individualistic. I’m wondering if there are shared patterns. For example you’ve got mirror neurons and empathy stuff. Could you have “cut and paste” empathy? Like if I’m feeling sad, the mood lighting in a family home turns blue and everyone else gets sad as well? Could such mechanisms be used across these relationships? In Futurama, there’s an episode where Bender gets an “empathy chip” so he feels whatever Leela is feeling for eg. We currently use indirect mechanisms like music or food to drive mood/emotion links." [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "There's a strong temptation with all these sci-fi trope type ideas to go for the hero's journey version of the idea, but the forms that I think are often more likely often have a certain signature banality to them ("manufactured normalcy" as I've called it). 
      
      So one heuristic I'd suggest is -- in thinking of interesting collisions, look for ways a pattern could actually become boring/banal/anti-dramatic. The thing about innovations when they actually land is, they seem so normal, it's hard to make a movie about it, or tell a story about it. 
      
      The internet itself is a good example. It arrived in a way that's much bigger than anything imagined by William Gibson etc. but also somehow more boring/banal by the time it did." [[Venkatesh Rao]]

      The synchronization of brain and environment moves closer with each advent. The difference with Kernel is... a recursive, real-time sync?" [[Scott Garlinger]]
    - "I watched upload, pretty good... but I have to say, that's one of my impossibility hypotheses... due to hard problem of consciousness, I personally believe transferring identity to a different substrate is conceptually impossible/ill-posed" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "But extraction of memory prior to death and delivery of that memory in digital twin format is something that may be practical. So a practical adjacent?
      
      Yes, for sure. I wrote a blog post based on that premise several years ago. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/03/06/immortality-in-the-ocean-of-infinite-memories/ " [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "Definitely I think high-fidelity AI-based copies of input/output behaviors of people will be possible by 2040... gpt2 already does an eerily good job tweeting like me. I think it may be possible to get primitive memory grafts/prosthetics by then, where at least at a vague level you can have your brain attached to somebody else's old memories in external-hard-drive mode." [[Venkatesh Rao]] 
    -  "I think the idea of traffic jams isn't to discover problems per se, but to get to 
      next-order effects beyond ideating on the technology itself. Getting to a "so what", culturally or otherwise." [[Chris Reid]]
    - "For both neuro-clones and for recording experiences, I think there would be some kind of emergent behavior where people who have done it second guess themselves more because because they may not remember the experience the way it is recorded, or their self image may be completely different from the neuro-clone. The visceral experience of looking at your own experiences/talking to neuro-clone could be a 'traffic jam'." [[Sachin Benny]]
    - "There is a mega-collision going on across all the folkways I just realized. Just like the internet created a digital native/digital migrant divide where the natives are able to somehow process at 1-2 levels above the migrants (eg, it is second nature to check whether a thing is fake, it is instinctive to think in terms of virality etc etc), a neural "second nature" may emerge... and it may collide with the digital "second nature"... basically the classic transhumanist collision of digital extension of self vs. biological extension of self. So a book-end concept I may try to build out is that of a "neuronative vs. neuromigrant"..."  [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "Are Kernel devices (current and future) bridges from nuero to digital only or also from digital to nuero and nuero to nuero?" [[Jay Kalawar]]
      
      "afaik, the main mode for going digital to neuro is in fact through the eyes or  ears. the tech for direct neural stimulation via intracranial electrodes is there of course, as is transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation, but it's kinda really limited to random things that happen to be accessible that way." [[Venkatesh Rao]]
      
      "i think there is also the possibility of transferring information through other sense pathways. Cyborg nest is working on creating a synthetic sense of orientation through haptic feedback. I am at least aware of some attempts to stimulate nasal pathways electrically (no idea how succesful that really is going to be but they can make you smell random stuff currently).  I think the idea is you can pipe in a random structured signal through any pathway and the brain eventually figures out how to interpret it as sensory input. thats how cochlear implants work (not by emulating normal hearing), how you can give blind people sight through audio pathways, etc" [[Drew Schorno]]

    - "conversation made me think maybe data collection volume = inference resolution?  I.e. 2 points is a line, 3 points is a plane, 30,000 points is a topography?" [[]]
    - "analogy: Kernel could be thought of as the intel/Fairchild  of BCI?" [[Sachin Benny]]
    - "a n = many idea I have been kicking around is the idea of creating a blockchain-based derivative asset that represents an ongoing measurement of "morale". Could also become a more objective version of Gross national happiness (GNH)" [[Drew Schorno]]
    - "Really fun book about brains and metaphors, which I'll have a podcast interview about coming out soon: https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Brain-Past-Future-Neuroscience-ebook/dp/B07WSD9KBV" (Joseph Fridman)
    - "i think @Venkatesh Rao (US Pacific) you astutely called out the n=1 trap that we spent some time in today, as they are definitely looking at the n=many as a key value add...relevant quote '**what is the equivalent of the google-book-dataset for the brain?**' " [[Luke Butler]]
    - "debrief thoughts:
      1. currently very focused on research and b2b applications rather than personal ones — why did we pick 20 years out? maybe extending a couple more decades could allow us to mine more of the sci-fi stuff we've been talking about
      1a. there was a heavy emphasis on stirring the imagination of researchers
      1b. just how sci-fi should we get at this point? 
      1c. how did the price point projection get to $3k ?  (i think the deck stated a date for 203x). not sure how money is valued in 20 years, but that's still $$ 
      2. metaphor i'm thinking about right now brainome as animal crossing this is the ultimate secondbrain, digital garden fodder.... IF the brainome can connect to your roam
      3. security/privacy model + an imagination of the computing stack could use some consideration. since we're talking a number of APIs, service integrations." [[Darren Kong]]
    - "another quote that stands out from Brian: "we don't really have practice using neural data in society...why haven't we built society around the brain" I think gets at ways we may want to shift thinking about the various folkways / traffic jams that continueto emerge...another related quote 'we have our work ahead of us to show the world the value of neural data'" [[Luke Butler]]
    - "20 years was my design call for this exercise, precisely to rein in ungrounded sci-fi speculation while still getting well past normal business planning horizons. Thread the needle between minimum near-future-scifi horizon which is ~40 years/1 generation, and maximum business horizon, ~11 years VC investment horizon
      **Reminder: everything embargoed, if in doubt, don’t talk about it outside this group unless kernel has already gone public with it.**" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - **"So in some key ways, the “product” in the initial phase is really the data rather than the devices. Whether offered NaaS or via small market device sales"** [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "I think 20y out we can assume PC in 1990 type penetration of devices. By then every middle manager had a PC and was using Excel type spreadsheets to manage work. With nascent email/internet use, and manu people sharing a PC at home it work" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "Let’s be careful not to fall into the trap of trying to figure out their business plan for them. Let’s assume they’ll make this work and succeed. Our job is to ask — what then? What happens if they actually pull this off?
      Ie, they’ll generate the data, figure out financing/making money etc, getting researchers going, enabling startups to build off their data, all that is their problem. Our problem is: then what happens," [[Venkatesh Rao]]
- Folkways
    - [[Vlad Meh: Naming Ways, Magic Ways]]
        - The main ideas I'm toying with is (1) would you would need to name things if you could communicate with minds rather than language? and (2) the ontological outcome if emotions/feelings replace language/symbols to name things
        - For naming ways, I’m mostly thinking of proper names of people. In fantasy fiction there’s the concept of “true names” for eg. Could unique neural patterns be used to name people by neurotype? Like “Joe Introvert” or something subtler? Another random connection that occurred to me is the Bouba/Kiki effect. Can the subjective feel of words become more important in how people, brands etc are named? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect  [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        -  I have been having a breakout discussion about public/private shared contexts and how your name would change based on these contexts. Plays to the "true name" idea as well - perhaps only very few people every have your canonical name. Similar to proliferation of usernames / addresses with the internet/various social networks except far more specific
    - [[Scott Garlinger: Sex Ways]]
        - A main thing is to sort out a useful, pg-13 frame to begin
        - How could a survival / excess distinction sort the conversation with the project's concerns in mind? The idea would use sex ways as a means to get to other things (Rather than taking objects/concepts into the field of sex ways)
        - An interesting rewiring would be "you were using sex as a means to this end; what if we just route you directly?"
        - Re: Sex ways & marriage ways - Esther Perel is a sex therapist who writes a lot about the paradox of maintaining both intimacy and mystery in a relationship. Using neuroscience to increase intimacy at the expense of mystery could create traffic jams around desire [[Amanda Reeves]] https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/13/mating-in-captivity-esther-perel/

        - So if we focus on trust building as foundation of Family ways, what are the neural correlates? Experiment: Design an experiment to capture and research neural signals that correlate to trust. Here is a link that may be a starting point?: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2148426/

        - "NaaS i would look forward to subscribing to (assuming reasonable cost and privacy guarantees): create my cloud based digital twin over a long period of time. Can tweak memories out and smooth out ticks may be etc. Only i can access my digital twin, until my death when i will it over to one or more heirs on a read only basis." 
    - [[Shreeda Segan: Death Ways]]
        - I’d really like to learn more about the subjective mental state of the last minutes. Does your life really flash in front of your eyes, etc? I can imagine a neuro-death ritual practice, where people die broadcasting their last mental states. Macabre perhaps but a sort of death-twitter where a kernel device broadcasts interpretations of last stages (emotions, memory region, pain...) [[Venkatesh Rao]]
        - Also I imagine people having some way of "prepping" for their death experience would be pretty great. Eventually being able to somehow retrofit that data to curate an optimized end of life experience
        - "crowdshared death" as a phrase comes to mind, too. some fusion with funeral ritual
        - I feel responses  during a close one's loss is also an interesting thing to explore. 
          a. How do we better handle it ?
          b. How do we cope up with it in the medium term ?
          c. Some indications on our own mental health during period of mourning 
          d. How do we respond to near death trauma ourselves ? 
          [[Siva Swaroop]]
        - Re: Death ways, We extract memory may be in the final moments of someone's life.
          a. Confessions
          b. Get passwords ( may be too creepy) to prevent digital ghosting
          c. Identification of killer in a crime scene
          Before finding colliding themes to these ideas, what exactly is memory and can we measure it,  retrieve it ? [[Siva Swaroop]]
        - Assuming we can do that, I think that'd be a really interesting literalization of someone living on in the hearts and minds of others after death. That sounds like a big possible culture shift in attitudes towards death- the cessation of new episodes of YourLife, but with reruns continuing in syndication. I assume the deceased would insist on being the curator while alive. It could be a natural evolution of social media curation- we've all probably seen Facebook accounts turn to mausoleums over the years. [[Chris Reid]]
        - I was thinking it would be compelling for psychiatrists to use kernel style helmets to identify true suicidality, not necessarily personally endorsing this.
          but something about suicide/euthanasia rights as well
        - here is a potentially interesting collision: AIs can predict death https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bias-predict-death/
        - Regarding family ways, age ways, i was just reading the pattern language on life cycles and how erasure of visible markers of transition detracts from the ability to live life fully
        - "regarding death ways, there's something interesting about how automation + atomization leads to people being "alive" to society but dead in actuality"
    - [[Scott Allen: Social Ways, Marriage Ways]]
        - "I'll be hyperbolic and say that everyone who has ever been married has at some point in time wished they could read their partner's thoughts."
        - "Thinking about marriage ways, and trying not to overlap too much with sex ways or social ways, or the obvious use in conjunction with therapy, I'm drawn to focus in on the commitment to intimacy that is a marriage."
        - "i think people who are married or are considering it also wonder constantly if they are truly compatible in some sort of deterministic way, "am i just wasting my time" and some neurocompatibility service would be compelling to get some sort of definite answer/security, obviously with lots of controversy"
        - "if you think of stuff like the "girlfriend experience" (the show as well as that pattern of prostitution), you can think of "marriage experience" if you can get to the right level of intimacy quickly enough using neuro-aids" 
        - "Now, I think the vast majority of people would be viscerally resistant to having some sort of open, automatic communication to their partner about what they're thinking/feeling, even if it's as broad as a general emotion."
        - "We can look at this in two different ways.. marriage as a social contract and  marriage as a unconditional intimate relationship with another mind."
        - "This link is generally interesting to all in this cluster... the japanese rent-a-family industry. It could be an interesting collision for this whole cluster if it becomes the norm beyond japan. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry "
        - "Thinking outside the box, I'm seeing this not as merely an enhancement to the current marriage relationship paradigm, but as a whole new paradigm for those who are willing to explore it."
        - "Can this tech be used by the Church to ascertain if the bride and groom are at what level of relationship ( contractual or deeper ) and if the couple is really agreeing to each other ?"
        - "I think entirely new kinds of marriage-like relationships could be enabled
          like there's the joke about the "work wife/work husband" pattern -- the complementary gender person at your workplace you harmonize most with and are most "intimate" with in a work sense (with risk for cheating/affairs too). You can have "neurotype wife/husband" with someone you meet online and never even see"
        - ""Folie à deux, shared psychosis, or shared delusional disorder is a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief and sometimes hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another" collision stuff (potentially)"
        - "I'm currently engaged and thinking about some of these ideas as pre-nuptual activities. Like a "neural bonding of the emotions" weekend retreat a month before the wedding"
        - A kind of forced-listening, perhaps. You don't have to integrate the other's perspective, but you have to experience it. As part of court-ordered mediation"

    - [[Amanda Reeves: Age Ways]]
        - My initial hook in Age Ways is considering how neuroscience could be used to detect behavioural changes in people with dementia, delirium, or Alzheimers to detect early signals of agitation and respond by playing familiar music as an alternative to medical interventions that prevents escalation to aggressive behaviours
        - That makes sense! I could imagine that with widespread monitoring, we might begin to pathologize & preempt forms of mild atrophy that are considered normal, non-pathological effects of aging on the brain too. [[Chris Reid]]

        - Youthful brains in older adults https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/37/9659
          
        - One of my own strong interests is in time perception, and one of the fascinating things about aging is that there are clear differences in how older people think versus younger based on the perceived time-left-to-live horizon (see Linda Cartensen research at Stanford). Young people end up with the same "old" time horizon attitudes when diagnosed with a terminal illness, or caught up in war or pandemic or other conditions where the future seems foreshortened.
