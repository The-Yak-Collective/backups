- working on **Coεmeta** (https://coemeta.xyz), most legibly described as **data & sensemaking services with positive externalities**, but ultimately bigger / weirder vision
    - spent **~10 wagecuck years** in **data**, **decision science** & **systems analysis**
    - **went indie end of 2021**, more contractor than consultant in Art of Gig parlance (documenting my __pathless path__ [here](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log))
    - current intense __special interest__: **affordances for partnerships / mutual aid / solidarity economies among indies**
    - been a longtime fan & follower (& client/custy) of various yaks (ben mosior, paul millerd, maggie, anne, venkat obv). stoked to absorb more & engage with yall (...at some pace)
    - **Twitter**: [@dnlmc](https://twitter.com/dnlmc)
    - **Tagline**: low & slow (tech) | thick & warm (data) | positive-sum & infinite (games)
    - **Previously**: Data & Decision Science @ Philadelphia Inquirer, Naval systems analyst (civilian)
