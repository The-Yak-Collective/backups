- I'm Antoine living in Quebec (GMT-5). 
- I currently work for a small strategy consulting firm (<10 ppl). Our clients are mid-market software companies that either need to transform themselves or need help in managing growth. 

- Current interests: sensemaking, myths and narratives (memes!) in organizations, large scale system change, path dependance/creation, forms of power in org structures. 
- Here to collaborate to research. I can't stand MBB marketing anymore.
