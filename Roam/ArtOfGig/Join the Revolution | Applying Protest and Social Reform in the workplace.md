- This is a project proposal for July 2020 cycle by [[Evan Carmi]]
- **Motivation**
    - The energy and enthusiasm for shifting our society, particularly around racial inequity, has dramatically grown since the end of May 2020. This energy, excitement, and the social changes that are being called for will inevitable land on workplaces. Some workplaces will be ahead of the curve, adapting proactively. Some workplaces will wait until they're forced to react, perhaps via boycotts, perhaps via lack of employee retention.
    - This project explores ways and ideas to consult and shift workplace culture to be on the proactive side, rather than the reactive side. This can build on the "Don't Waste the Reboot" idea towards a "Don't Waste the Protests" theme.
    - This project will require self-reflection, self-awareness and a deep understanding of the privileges and differences those working on the project all have. It will require hard, uncomfortable conversations.
- **Process and Framework**
    - Uncertain, by design. Rather than taking an approach of limiting and "handling for" uncertainty. The process will seek to include and allow uncertainty, and use the uncertainty as a creative source and conversation starter. If this scares you, this is probably not the project for you. We will embrace uncertainty and trust that a path will unfold. See [Presence](https://smile.amazon.com/Presence-Human-Purpose-Field-Future/dp/0385516304)
    - The principles used in the development of this project will be the principles used in the work this project advocates for.
- **Deliverable:**
    - A slide deck with ideas and examples of this effort and list of Yaks who are available to consult with companies around these ideas.
