    - "Given that the technology presented is about measuring and inferring the meaning of signals, and not stimulating, how would these interventions work?" (Joseph Fridman)
      "Do you see fundamental limits in the current approach to neuroscientific research which suggest that precise neurostimulation would not be possible in the next two decades? To me it seems non-trivial but possible with Musk's neuralink style invasive tech." [[Vinay Débrou]]
      "Anything is possible with enough money, but I wouldn’t bet on non invasive precise stimulation in 20 years. Invasive is an entirely different ballgame. (Joseph Fridman)
    - "Non-invasively, one can use sensory substitution as a way to write-in. Take excess bandwidth in touch and teach your brain to use the haptic feedback signal. " [[Nikhil Deshmukh]]
      "Sensory substitution is a more plausible futures assumption even if less dramatic in sci-fi value." [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "Actually measuring "the will of the people"" [[Drew Schorno]]
    - "A thread of legal thinking that I think really brings out the complexities around neural rights is the great-ape personhood stuff." https://news.mongabay.com/2018/10/citizen-ape-the-fight-for-personhood-for-humans-closest-relatives/ [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "**Also, a general prompt to all... think harder in terms of positive collisions. Negative collisions are much easier to imagine, so you have to work harder to think of positive collisions. **
      
      Example: electric vehicle boom is a collision of 2 big trends: falling solar prices, and the development of lithium ion. Youtube etc are a collision of 2 trends: falling bandwidth costs, and improving CCD camera tech. Look for those serendipitous collisions that create wealth and value, not as much at negative ones that create conflict."  [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "fyi... neurofuturama dot org and dot com are available right now, and I pinged bryan in case they want to buy it and said I would if they didn't... they don't want to maintain another web property, so I'm going to buy on spec for us. Option to leverage the momentum of this project into a running neuro-futures project" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "what if neurotypes become the basis of a new kind of race/ethnicity dimension?" [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "This post is good calibration on how to best serve the potential audience for this project: startup founders for future neurotech companies that might build on kernel-generation tech

      We don't want to generate ideas for this crowd, but give them raw material to feed their own idea generation." [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "pay per dopamine hit"  [[Nikhil Deshmukh]]
    - "slightly banal version of this would be - mechanical turk but for neural tech. You can basically sell time on your brain to other people, they will offload simple tasks for you to do. This could be part of age ways." [[Sachin Benny]]
