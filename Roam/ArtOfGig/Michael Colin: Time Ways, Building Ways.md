- **Building Ways**
    - __Prevailing forms of vernacular architecture and high architecture, which tend to be related to one another.__
        - Studies investigating environmental enrichment have shown that exposure to enhanced sensory, cognitive, motor and social stimulation results in behavioural, cellular and molecular alterations in animal models. [1][2]
        - Evidence-base for the neurophysiological impact from environmental enrichment in humans has not been widely examined [3][4], though some evidence-based approaches exist. [5][6]
        - The built environment is a significant component of environmental enrichment; impact of the design of interior & exterior spaces on human emotion.
        - MEG (Flux) and fMRI (Flow) used to gather more comprehensive data on emotional reactions to form & geometry, furniture style & context, height & enclosure, material & texture, etc.
        - Portability of devices allow non-clinical observation of architecture’s emotional influence.
        - Stronger evidence-base from application of neuroscience to architecture & design may shift the disciplines from an aesthetic focus to one of health & well-being, similar to emotion-focused approaches e.g. Ilse Crawford. [7] 
        - Increased evidence-base would give more power & incentive over design approval to policymakers, especially for urban development. 
        - Positive externalities re: livability of urban environments, work environments, etc.

- **Time Ways**
    - __Attitudes towards the use of time, customary methods of time keeping, and conventional rhythms of life.__
        - Two-way brain interfacing as a means to affect perception of time, e.g. in the case of prisoners to serve sentences, is likely too sci-fi for the scope of this project. [1]
        - That does not mean that gathering data on time perception for a given activity will not be useful. Portability of Kernel interfaces allow for a better measurement of subjective time derived from the ongoing flow of experience. [2] 
        - The neural clock operates by organizing the flow of our experiences into an orderly sequence of events. This activity gives rise to the brain’s clock for subjective time. [3][4]
        - **Episodic Time **- Experience, and the succession of events within experience, are thus the substance of which subjective time is generated and measured by the brain.
        - Better research into granular mechanisms of episodic time shifts give individual more power to positively affect their perception of time. Existing tactics are largely comprised of the banal "Make a Change" and "Break Your Routine." [5]
        - Kernel can help identify optimum temporal structure to maximize focus and/or well-being. This will have major impacts in socially acceptable use of time from the current productivity-centric model to a self-care model as better data allows the use of time to materially and objectively enhance well-being. 
        - Potential for radical shifts in the way we structure our day due to the exploitation of "time hacks." Feedback loops can be created based on the relationship between emotion and time. [6]
        - Examples of where neurodata on subjective perception of time can be used to:
            - **Corporations** - Maximize worker productivity & focus through evidence-based meeting & day structure. __Note: See how this could affect Work Ways__
            - **Film & Art** - Study the use of emotional scenes and its impact on the viewer's experience. [7]
            - **Mindfulness** - Reduce an individual's tendency toward temporal illusions, e,g, Telescoping Effect, Vierordt's Law, Oddball Effect, etc. [8] __Note: Outline second order effects of temporal illusion reductions.__
