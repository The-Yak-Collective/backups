- I see this as a video deconstruction of meetings we have, annotated with play by play of choices made
- Why?
    - Remote work brings new games to play and new ways to play old business games.  
    - Early adopters of remote work were often similar in their worldviews, preferring makers and independent work, or draconian under the API microtasks.  
    - The new adopters of remote work favor a world where the office is a place of status games, managers thrive over makers, and buy-in is more important than build-in.  
    - In this new world of remote work
        - how do you use nonverbal cues to negotiate better?  
        - What can you learn from the camera presentation to adapt faster?
        - How can you use entry and exit to elevate or lower your status in a Zoom meeting?
