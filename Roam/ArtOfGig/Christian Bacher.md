- Hi there.
- I am a consultant, project manager, business developer, startup advocate, sustainability specialist.
- Worked for Deutsche Bank, Deloitte, SAP, mostly in consulting roles to their respective clients
- Did many projects in process re-design, sustainability reporting/management, supply chain innovations, innovation management for large corporate clients
- Last job was to create and run a Startup Accelerator for SAP to scout, onboard, and develop to SAP partner later stage startups in the supply chain domain
- Having worked on paycheck for 12 years now I decided to leave with the ambition to create impact for a cleaner/greener/more sustainable future by the means of developing businesses and dive deeper into Berlin's/Germany's/Europe's Green-/Cleantech startup ecosystem
- I am officially on freelance/gigs by July 2020 which I originally thought of being an intermediate or part-time experience, before I enter the next job. But I may find some more interest in it, so 2020 is my experimentation year (Corona just makes it much more interesting). I never did freelance before.
- I am German by nationality, based in [[Germany/Berlin]].
- Why am I here
    - 1) I like the works of Venkatesh Rao and keep following him loosely since the Breaking Smart Series 1 (which was mindblowing to me)
    - 2) As I expect that others are some sort of inspired by his writings gather here I am really looking forward to exchange thoughts, ideas, methods.
    - 3) I consider the Yak Collective as a very exciting experience on reinventing organizations leaving behind the traditional bureaucratic/industrial way to do so. Very interesting to watch the experience and how it evolves.
    - 4) As this is a platform for indie consultants I think this will soon be a platform for joint and paid projects as well. I may be in the position to acquire gigs as well as others. I may need support and resources to staff the projects. So this may be a great pool to source from.
