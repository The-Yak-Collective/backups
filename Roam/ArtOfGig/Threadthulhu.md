A general interest in break-king illegible learning processes into their component steps and refining them. A kind of process skill mindfulness. Like 6-sigma but for learning.

                - Humans program each other by prompt engineering too, so it's interesting to see that form of programming becoming increasingly prevalent with computers. Programming turns into a kind of applied psychology of neural nets, biological or synthetic.

                - Initially I thought ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù should be called ‚Äúmagic spells‚Äù since you‚Äôre commanding illegible forces to do improbably miraculous seeming things with the right words, but this is exactly wrong. Prompt engineering illuminates and demystifies. It‚Äôs anti-magic spells!

                - Step-by-step-ism (needs a better name) is exactly the antidote we need to a bunch of unhealthy things:

- vibing as a bad substitute for sense-making
- derangement syndromes as a chronic state of mental ill-health
- uncritical brute-force trial-and-error that learns nothing
                - I think we‚Äôre about to discover that there are ‚Äú10x teachers‚Äù and that prompting skill is fat-tailed

Prompting and step-by-stepping is basically skilled teaching, whether it‚Äôs silicon or living neural nets. Except in the former you can also do some ‚Äúbrain surgery‚Äù

                - In general, I guess this is a swing away from both ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù intuitionism where you get from A to B via a stroke of illegible genius AND away from the move-fast-break-things mode of inefficient learning where you get a high learning rate at the cost of high waste and risk
                - A more ‚Äúslow is smooth, smooth is fast‚Äù approach to mindful learning.
                - There is also going to be a tendency to deny there us anything new here and an effort to identify this development with a favored old tradition. I‚Äôd suggest resisting that temptation. 

There‚Äôs more than ‚ÄúSocratic method, you invented the Socratic method!‚Äù here.

                - Oh, the big upside here is that only the *original* discovery of effective prompt patterns is a rare skill. Once discovered, others can easily copy. An ordinary gym teacher should be able to copy that clever backflip teaching method.
                - There‚Äôs a potential for a network effect here, and good prompt patterns driving out weak ones. 
                - And of course, a clever architecture may allow AIs to discover good prompt patterns to. PromptGAN?

                - I have a fair amount of college teaching experience. Enough to know I‚Äôm not naturally talented at this. Once I know something, I find it hard to put myself in the shoes (motherboards?) of someone who does not know. But when I‚Äôm in a patient mood I can sort of do it okay.
