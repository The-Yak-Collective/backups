- About me:: Not a consultant, but after reading some of the [[Art of Gig]], the books, and what some of the other [[Yak]] members work on, I may become one. Most of my thoughts could be found on my [personal site](www.lesgreys.com). Mostly active on [[Farcaster]] as @les. Founder of [greyapp](greyapp.xyz) where I'm looking to further crypto adoption by bringing [[retail [[fashion]]]] into a digitally native space through [[consumer social]].
