- I'm a [[Full-Stack]] developer (React, Python, [[Clojure]]), and part-time CS teacher at Lambda. Currently (May 2021) I'm studying for the GRE so I can go to grad school so I can do ML professionally so I can work on longevity.
    - I'm here because I like the idea of Yaks collaborating on weird projects in a flexible economy. It feels so Rainbow's End.
    - I used to was a soldier and then used to was a lawyer. I live in a heck of a fixer-upper in Austin. I ski in the winter and box the rest of the year.
    - I want to build a GAN to make art, and a trading bot, and other weird things.
