- This was our first [[Pop-Up Think Tank]] project
- If you do a reflection post, please link it in this page: [[Reflections and Reviews ]]
- This is the first of what we hope will be many [[Projects Directory]]. This one is being coordinated by [[Paul Millerd]]. Target date for V 1.0 release: **April 30th**
- To discuss, join the Collaborations channel on the [[Yak Discord server]]
- **Purpose**: We are looking to put together a pitch deck of at least 20 Indie Ideas - short & punchy 1-2 slides per idea.  The frame of the deck is as a stark difference to the bland "new new new normal" McKinsey and other mainstream views.  Showing that we have something to offer idea-wise and in practical hire-us ways.
- Deck in progress: [Google slides link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OfBuSq4SImE1Gq2EaAGCAlkwC8LZRCWx-7O_VOHJ5TI/edit?usp=sharing)

- Timeline of launch and promotion: 
    - VERSION 1 launched by **Thursday April 30** on the mailing lists of all contributors who have one. Using this [[25 pieces launch email talking points]] and a twitter thread summary tweeted out by @artofgig account summarizing the 20 ideas in 1 tweet each, and tagging the author of each tweet.
    - We do a ZOOM call led by Paul to work out a rough talk track so any of us can deliver at least a shallow-pass version of the WHOLE deck, based on how the author of each segment does it. Maybe we'll record a version where each person does their bit. 
    - We find 1-2 pilot clients, maybe pro-bono to deliver the deck live to, and get endorsements, which we add to Version 2 of the deck.
    - Launch Version 2 of the deck.
    - Aspirational: if this thing actually gains traction and a few orgs use it, we start adding "case study" slides to the end, showing how different orgs used this.
