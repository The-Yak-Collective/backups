- The foundation of an effective virtual offsite remains basic meeting management: clear objectives, a well-crafted agenda, concise pre-reads, a well-chosen group of attendees, documented decisions, and specific next steps, etc.
- **Prepare for your virtual offsite**
    - **Provide attendees with the tools they’ll need.** Whether detailed in the pre-read, or in a brief pre-meeting session, instruct everyone on exactly how to install and set up the software and video technology needed to participate.
    - **Ensure everyone knows how to use the technology.** Provide opportunities to practice using all the features to be used during the offsite.
    - **Carefully design the offsite’s flow and conduct a dry run.**
        - For each section of the meeting, start with what you want to achieve, sketch out each exercise initially independent of the technology, then consider what’s possible with the software. 
        - Make sure you keep the activities simple enough for your least technologically advanced attendees.
        - Meeting organizers and facilitators should practice every module of the meeting exactly how it is envisioned.
        - Given technology limitations, it can be more difficult in a virtual setting to shift and redesign a meeting “on the fly,” so make sure you are equipped with plans B and C if needed.
    - **Assign clear roles. **Like a movie production, individuals running the offsite need to be clear on who should do what. 
        - Who facilitates each conversation? 
        - Who handles the technology including screen sharing, monitoring chat, calling on attendees who “raise hands”? 
        - Who should attendees contact if they have technical difficulties? 
        - Who steps in for the facilitator if he or she encounters technical challenges?
    - **When in doubt, limit the size of the group.** A common mistake made with offsites is to invite too many participants.
- **Conduct your virtual offsite**
    - **Display a welcome screen when people join the meeting.** As attendees sign on, welcome them with specific instructions or reminders on the screen to ensure they are set up for the session.
    - **Make it interactive from the start. **We recommend an activity or ice breaker at the beginning to connect participants and make them comfortable with the virtual setting.
    - **Set clear ground rules.** Like any offsite, you need ground rules. 
        - Typical ones we use for in-person offsites still apply – return from breaks on time, be candid and honest, headline your comments, use tricks for cutting people off, etc. 
        - Others will be specific to virtual meetings – “raise hand” instead of jumping in, stay on video throughout, mute when possible (but no need to apologize for the occasional barking dog or crying baby).
    - **Take more frequent breaks.** Because participants are sitting in front of a screen for the duration, we find that 15-minute breaks every 90 minutes give people time to reset, handle other business needs, and deal with issues at home.
    - **Minimize presentations, maximize discussion.** We’ve said this before, but long presentations can really destroy a meeting’s momentum. Background information, whenever possible, should be well edited and provided in advance.
    - **Use technology to maximize participation, engagement and interactivity.** Gathering input constantly during a virtual offsite is critical, especially since visual cues are more difficult to read.
        - **Breakouts. **Though not available on all systems, putting attendees in small virtual groups helps to break up the day and provides a more intimate setting to solve problems.
        - **Voting.** Poll people early and often. don’t just ask yes-or-no questions. Questions that ask attendees to indicate the extent to which they agree with a statement often on a 1 (do not agree) to 5 (completely agree) scale go further in really teasing out opinions virtually.
        - **Stamping. **Similar to placing dots on a wall chart in an in-person offsite, allowing participants to annotate or “stamp” a shared screen is a powerful way for all attendees to provide feedback, indicate preferences, or identify where they have questions.
        - **Chat.** While you might need some ground rules to prevent the conversation from becoming unruly, chat provides an additional forum for attendees to offer opinions to the full group or directly to the meeting facilitators.
    - **Gather session feedback.** Solicit attendees’ feedback while the experience is fresh in their minds.
        - What could be improved? If we could “run the tape” over what would be different? 
        - Then ask: What went well? What should be repeated? What did you like?
