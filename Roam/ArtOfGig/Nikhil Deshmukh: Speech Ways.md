- Definition from Albion source material: "Speech ways - conventional patterns of written and spoken language: pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, syntax"
    - abbreviated below as P, V, G, S  
    - what about role of language? not capture in patterns above - written and spoken and thought

- We don't need language to think, but we do need language to communicate. what is the pronunciation,vocab, grammar, syntax of mental concepts? (chomsky universal grammar?) Are thoughts chunked and streamed or sent whole? How "big" of a concept can one stream brain to brain? Does every brain have the capacity to understand every concept? What are the bottlenecks? 
- Listening and understanding vs. grokking 
- Kernel can make non-verbal communication more explicit and legible for those on the austism spectrum 
- Internet and keyboards as input device changed language compared to written and spoken word. IRC, AOL instant messenger led to rise of emoticon, then emoji, which was a creative use of the limitations of the keyboard to express emotions. The exact characters varied by region, e.g. smiles and laughter emoticons are different in Asia than in the US. Emoticons/ emoji were filling in the void left by removing the nonverbal communication in speech and body language. What voids are created by moving communication to neural signaling? Can we even transmit what something feels like? Would emojis be deprecated as we regain non-verbal comms directly brain to brain?(V,G) 
- Long-form writing is rarer now with technology and the salami slicing of information into shareable bite sizes on twitter. Could the same happen to verbal speech as a modality? Brain to brain comms replace talking with others, speech is saved for formal occasions, and writing is even rarer, like engraving and painting (G,S)
- Neural annotations from Kernel NLP doc 
    - extract error signals from users' brains interacting with conversational AI (NLP language models) to train the models very quickly (online learning). 
    - n-of-many: use brains to train conversational AI, which doesn't need feedback for deployment/inference 
    - not just a better Alexa or neuro-clones of ones' speech patterns. speech synthesis for behavioral outcomes. mashup your content with non-semantic cues for extra cognitive consonance or dissonance. 
        - hypnosis
        - motivation (mighty ducks "ducks fly together" )
        - real-time translation 
        - personalized, real-time summarization based on what's novel to you 
            - don't encode the content of speech, encode the diffs from your worldview
            - allows versioning and tracking of your history - which inputs led to which changes in perspective 
- interesting language from the discord thread 
    - neuro as prefix currently overused - neuroeconomics, neurotheology etc. (V) 
        - neuro will become implicit, prefix will disappear and names will revert back to economics, theology 
    - neuro-clickbait (Venkat)
        - optimized ads/text/video based on neural responses
