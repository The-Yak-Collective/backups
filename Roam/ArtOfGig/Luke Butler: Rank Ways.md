- **Description of Rank Ways from Albion**
    - The rules by which rank is assigned, the roles which rank entails, and relations between different ranks
- **Initial Free Brainstorm**
    - Thinking about how the neurotech could be used when considering implications for hierarchical and non-hierarchical contexts- e.g., when you are with friends, could you determine if you are existing hierarchically in a non-hierarchical space?
    - There is danger in neurotech of assigning rank in ways that have to do with cognitive complexity in ways that have able-ist inclinations
    - We could look @ how people literally perceive / sense hierarchy with mapping visual cortex read outs + language & perception of hierarchy...
    - In the context of work, this could look like people coming together for discrete projects & assigning rank based on capabilities
    - Thinking about rank & the Dunbar #

        - __NOTE: This is seemingly unrelated, but talks about thinking about power as a determinant of interview success__
        - __QUOTE: “powerlessness is central to job applicants’ experience: they desire a job but depend on interviewers to get a position. This position undermines applicants’ sense of control and results in a sense of insecurity that can ultimately hurt their performance in the job-interview setting.”__

        - __NOTE: I think there are good idea to mine here, when thinking about temporarily assigning rank over certain aspects of work / life / etc.__
        - __QUOTE: Protocols don’t need to take the form of technical specifications. They can also make human interaction possible, as we can see taking place in operating theaters. When surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and supporting staff gather to perform an emergency surgery they all know the protocols they follow and learn very fast how they’ll interact with one another, even if they never worked together before. A work role for many individuals in the future will be to take part in networks that neither they nor anyone else controls. The key metric is how long it takes for people to cooperate efficiently.__

- **Shared Brainstorm Questions**
    - If you had access to the first generation of Kernel devices, what **EXPERIMENTS** would you run?
        - __I would want to run experiments on  __
    - What are the likely **TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS** on what is possible with Kernel type technology along a reasonable evolution path?
        - __Right now, being mainly focused on cortical matter, and not necessarily having the access to the lower, deeper parts of the brain that show what's going on beneath cortical processing...lots of attribution can be made in ways that don't get at what's going on underneath the proverbial hood__
    - What is the **INVENTION GAP** between where we are now and where we can reasonably expect to be in 2040, assuming typical rates of innovation? What features can we expect to have then that we don't have now?
        - ____
    - Are there things that are **DEFINITELY POSSIBLE** given what we know about physics/biology/electronics etc. even if it's not immediately clear how it would be done?
    - Are there things there any fundamental **IMPOSSIBILITIES** we should keep in mind to keep the speculation realistic?
    - What are some good **METAPHORS and MENTAL MODELS** for thinking about this kind of tech? Eg: like we think of the internet via the document metaphor
