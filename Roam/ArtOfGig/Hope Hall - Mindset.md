- When I feel overwhelmed or stressed or lose my center, I draw on one or all of these things:   
- Be kind & be useful.   
- Slow way, way down.   
- Let the world speak to you.   
- Rest your mind on your breath.   
- I am only as good as the company I keep.   
- How can I best support my own vulnerability?   
- Compassion is the highest form of critical thinking.   
- My life—which includes my work—is only as good as I feel.   
- Try to put how you want to feel ahead of what you want to be or even do.   
- This is what I'm doing, this thing, right now; drop the words, stick with the feeling.   
- Be ready for opportunities & openings as they come along; change is the only constant.   
- Go toward the good—the good people, the good moments—& let the rest of the static, noise & drama fall away.   
- While we're breathing—which is miraculous, and won't be happening some day—all we're doing is learning and growing. That's all, learning and growing.   
- Follow your interests, wherever they lead will be somewhere that lights up your eyes, or floats your cork; notice when you get excited &/or confused by things, write down these moments & let them guide you.
- When I realize I am distracted, I ask:   
- “What is standing between me & being present right now?”   
- When I’m confused by someone else’s behavior:   
- I try to imagine what it feels like to do or say what they’re doing or saying & feel that it is good, correct, right, justified, chosen, the way I typically feel about my own choices. More often than not, we believe we’re right. Everyone makes sense to themselves. Sometimes I call this personal logic.   
- When I’m humbled by a moment when I’m fumbling:   
- I smile & wave at the world and say, “This is me learning, right here & right now,” & to myself, gently, trying to  
- remember to laugh while I say it, “Challenges are opportunities for growth.”   
- When I feel myself shutting down in a stressful situation,  
- proverbially clenching my fist:   
- I imagine what it would be like to open my hand, gently, so that a feather or a bird could land on it (I know how cheesy that sounds, but I say it anyway). I dial down the seven inputs of experience (five senses, thoughts, and feelings) and tune in to the constant current of my witnessing consciousness. I notice my heart when it closes, then let the waves of feelings flow through my heart, unstuck. 
- The gifts my father left me:  
    - I refuse to be insulted;  
    - The trick is to be ready;  
    - How lucky are we to live in this beautiful place?
