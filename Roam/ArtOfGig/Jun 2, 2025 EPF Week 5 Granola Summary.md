- ### Ethereum Roadmap Overview
    - Comprehensive review of Ethereum’s development roadmap covering The Merge, Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge
    - Presented by Donati, mouthpiece of Ethereum Foundation Research & Development
    - Based on Vitalik’s yearly roadmap update
- ### The Merge Achievements & Ongoing Work
    - Implemented Proof of Stake with ~1 million active validators
    - $110 billion in economic security
    - Light client protocol implementation using committee of 512 validators
    - Secret leader election (WHISK protocol) in development
    - Finality achieved every 12.6 minutes (2 epochs)
    - Single slot finality (SSF) research ongoing with potential solutions:
        - Reducing active validator count
        - Signature aggregation schemes
        - Distributed validator stacks
- ### The Surge: Data Availability & Rollups
    - EIP-4844 implemented on mainnet
    - Current blob metrics:
        - Average 1.16 blobs per block
        - Target of 3 blobs per block
        - Cost: ~0.00013 ETH per blob
        - ~5 Gwei total burned by blob data
    - Data Availability Sampling (DAS):
        - Uses polynomial commitments
        - Requires only 30 samples for 1-in-a-billion confidence
        - Enables efficient data verification without full download
- ### The Verge: State Management
    - Verkle Trees implementation planned to replace Merkle Patricia Trees
    - Benefits:
        - Shorter proofs
        - 256 children per node vs current 16
        - ZK-friendly structure
        - Enables stateless validation
        - Potential to triple gas limit
    - Portal Network development for history access
    - SSZ standardization planned to replace RLP
- ### MEV & Staking Economics
    - Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) development
    - Execution tickets concept for block proposal rights
    - MaxEV plans to increase max effective balance from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH
    - Liquid staking improvements:
        - Protocol-level LST consideration
        - Potential 2 ETH cap on slashing penalties
    - Stake targeting research for ~25% of supply
- ### Account Abstraction & EVM Improvements
    - EOF (EVM Object Format) in development
    - Account abstraction priorities:
        - Smart wallet standards (ERC-4337)
        - Improved key management
        - Custom spending conditions
        - Social recovery options
    - EIP-1559 endgame improvements:
        - AMM-style curve implementation
        - Multidimensional resource pricing
        - Time-aware base fee calculation
- ### Future Cryptography Research
    - Quantum-resistant consensus mechanisms
    - Fully homomorphic encryption exploration
    - One-shot signatures research
    - Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) development
    - Encrypted mempool solutions for MEV mitigation
