- #[[2021 meeting notes]] Regular Yak Rover group meeting No:3 (10 PM Pacific, morning in Europe, afternoon in Japan).
    - Contents & Agenda (planned)
        - Quick overview of PLEXIL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLEXIL
            - PLEXIL is a framework developed at NASA, used on many missions to define the behaviour of "agents" (rover, satellites, smart habitats).
            - Since 2006, open source: https://sourceforge.net/p/plexil/.
            - Group questions
                - Is it an attractive candidate for the Yak Stack?
                - What can we learn for rovers?
        - Hardware at the "Spider Yak Mini Lab", aka rover Z1 environment.
            - Goals:
                - A toolkit for remote/autonomous operations, evaluation, measurements and telemetry.
                - Learning by doing: An attempt at a blueprint, and a bit of reinventing the wheels.
                - Output should be reusable software.
            - A dedicated corner of the room for a rover (about ~1m2, ~3ft2).
            - Tethered spider bot from HiWonder (computer a Raspberry Pi 4, full Linux).
            - SSH access to the team.
            - Video stream and snapshots from the bot front camera. E.g. snapshots: http://153.127.64.244:3537/?action=snapshot (please use little, weak bot :-|)
            - Thermal imaging of the bot from atop.
            - Roadmap for the quarter:
                - More remote operations, shared usage facilities, more telemetry.
                - New sensors, and measurements: OAK-1 camera, ultrasonic proximity, 1D LIDAR.
                - More landmarks.
            - Group questions:
                - Imagine you have the rover of your dreams. How do you ideally interact with it?
    - Minutes
        - Standups: Did, Next, Blockers. 
            - Venkatesh entering a shoping spree, and helping everyone by collecting information.
            - Victor on exploring ROS and Jupyter technologies for rover software.
            - Maier on Twitter, bots, and exploring concerns of finality: What do we really expect the rover to do, except roving? E.g. of drilling a cave (do not reproduce at home).
            - Anuraj on 3D-printing, slow this week due to moving.
            - Eric on basically trying PLEXIL and expanding the work environment of the SpiderBot with a thermal camera.
            - New attendees:
                - Phil: More into Mechanics (TBC), and suggesting to focus on more basics and Gall's law (or KISS as we say in software).
                - Jascha: Into Mechatronics (TBC), and excited at the prospect of attempting meta-robotic tasks too.
            - Next week: Venkatesh's revelation on shoping.
        - On software and PLEXIL
            - ROS comes back in the discussion, at least a good base to start with, even if we drop it later.
            - PLEXIL is interesting. Many wonder why so close to existing past frameworks like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_task_network or STRIPS.
            - Not clear what to do with PLEXIL at this point.
            - Discussion around what software should be doing anyway, beyond hardware control. Mention of goal definition and abstraction.
            - Discussion around map and mapping issues. How does that interact with goals?
            - If software is just to define goals, unclear what the goals are. Basic goals are reaching a destination and target tracking. On Mars, goals like drilling a cave or building a house are likely desired.
            - Anyway, we should keep it all simple and less abstract, at least for now.
            - Looking ahead what software should do to serve/innovate remains in the discussion. Eric will keep on watching the PLEXIL ecosystem (including whether it is actually used on Perseverance).
        - We did not directly discuss "How do you ideally interact with [the rover]?". It is partially covered in the discussion of software.
