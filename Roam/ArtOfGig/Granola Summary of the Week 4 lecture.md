- ### Overview of Testing Framework
    - Mario Vega from EF testing team presented on testing and security
    - Focus on developing functional testing for Ethereum execution layer
    - Primary testing repositories:
        - Ethereum Test (original repo)
        - Ethereum Execution Spec Test (newer repo)
    - Testing ensures all Ethereum execution clients adhere to specifications
    - Non-adherence can cause chain forks if consensus breaks
- ### EVM Testing Components
    - Pre-state: Contains smart contracts, balances, code and storage
    - Environment: Block-related info including timestamps, gas limits, base fees
    - Transactions: Single or multiple transactions to test specific functionality
    - Post-state: Expected outcome after transaction execution
    - Test filling process converts test design into JSON format consumable by clients
- ### Test Types and Implementation
    - State Tests: Single transaction with specific execution testing
    - Blockchain Tests: Multiple transactions/blocks with full chain functionality
    - FuzzyEVM: Random smart contract testing to find edge cases
    - Test formats:
        - State test format
        - Blockchain test format
        - Hive format for consensus testing
- ### Cross-Layer Testing
    - Tests interaction between execution and consensus layers
    - Hive framework enables spawning test clients
    - DevOps tools include:
        - Assertor for output validation
        - Kurtosis package for local chain testing
        - Tools for debugging and validation
- ### Security Testing Focus
    - Tests validate blocks comply with Ethereum specification
    - Key security concerns:
        - Invalid block validation
        - Denial of service vulnerabilities
        - Consensus layer faults at different node percentages:
            - <33%: Least concerning, chain continues
            - 33-50%: Can delay finality
            - 50%: Disrupts consensus
            - 66%: Most severe, requires intervention
- ### Bug Bounty Program
    - Bug bounty program available at [immunefi.com](http://immunefi.com/)
    - Rewards for finding security vulnerabilities
    - Private disclosure process
    - Previous disclosures documented in public repository
    - Encourages white hat security research
- ### Test Workflow
    - Test filling uses GoEthereum for transaction execution
    - Python source enables complex parameterization via PyTest
    - Generates test fixtures in JSON format
    - Every client must produce identical output for same input
    - Validation includes state root comparison
- ### Next Steps
    - Moving toward more automated testing frameworks
    - Enhancing cross-client compatibility testing
    - Developing additional security validation tools
    - Improving test coverage across all protocol aspects
    - Continuing to expand automated validation capabilities
