- NB that this didn't happen as a project, but/and thanks to collaboration with @Vinay Debrou, this got published:
- http://www.govtransformation.org/uncategorized/34-doughnuts-what-the-world-well-twitter-wants-to-tell-the-uk-government-about-recovery/
- OK - here's a chance to be really interesting - "assorted weirdos" (https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/). 
- On 15 April, a friend (a pioneer in the Yak-lite-like #oneteamgov movement), newly elevated to a 'systems unit' in the UK Cabinet Office (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/systems-unit) (systems/complexity/cybernetics is my jam) - posted this: https://twitter.com/jaCattell/status/1250357135428521984 - and got >1500 replies. 
- I posted a volunteer gig here and [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] took up the challenge, so I now have a neat excel of the results. We are planning dual blogs - on https://systemsthinking.blog.gov.uk/ and www.publicservicetransformation.org
- If we can do some good analysis - even a mini-deck, or a dataviz or something, this will actually get taken to the 'heart of government' and might make a difference (they are not yet ready to discuss publicly that they're working on a renewal strategy). And I'll be putting Vinay's 'raw data' out there for people to work on.
- There's a lot of politics, a lot of medical / scientific 'advice', a lot of insults... a lot of recommendations of 'Doughnut Economics' (35), Citizen Assemblies (11), climate crisis (81), UBI (42), talk to women (19), and a bundle of other comments around diversity. Fund social care (24).
- Also fits in to my learning community https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2020/04/the-days-after-a-learning-community-to-build-back-better/
- Anyone interested in partaking in this?

- [[Kannen Ramsamy]] Have been thinking about about co-production as a primary means for gov to deliver public policy post-COVID, with gov creating mechanisms to drive equal partnerships between professional service providers and citizens as service-users during the implementation of policy. This public governance approach can support health social care delivery/citizen engagement which were frequently mentioned in the Tweet responses. Could this fit into the gov renewal strategy?
- Yes, [[Kannen Ramsamy]]- that sounds very interesting.
- [[Patrick Atwater]] it might be interesting to broaden this to a bigger picture take on post-covid renewal and pick 3-5 regions / nations for case studies. There are many similar questions here in California for instance and I know McKinsey has been doing a dozen ish pro-bono engagements with governments around the globe to guide their recovery efforts. It might be particularly powerful to do say a nation-state like the UK, a region like California, a City like Singapore,... Could pick those based on Yak's expertise and a diverse perspective to paint a more interesting picture of the post-Covid uncertainty and how the current geopolitical upheaval could play out.
