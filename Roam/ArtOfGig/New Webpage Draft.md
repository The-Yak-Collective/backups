- New Name: 
    - Composable Computing/Yakshaving Computing/Agentic Computing
        - Grigori: I actually like Composable Computing. It is a fine name. It can, however, become unaccessible to outsiders, after a several weeks of discussions. Outsiders will feel terribly left behind.

    - __Also thinking of a pace layers piece since I've appreciated how we have occasionally jumped on something wripped from the headlines. Today we could have talked about Telegram, for example__ #[[jrd]]

            - Degree of centralization in a distributed system. 
            - There is a natural pull toward centralization, so you probably can't have 100% decentralized system. 
                - But how much of centralization you can actually afford without creating something that will degenerate toward centralization? 
                - And how much decentralization you can tolerate without going crazy.
