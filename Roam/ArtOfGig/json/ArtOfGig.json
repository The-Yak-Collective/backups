At the same time - don't forget to talk publicly about the transition.

If you're serious about transitioning to indie life I think the single most valuable thing your current role gives you is a steady paycheck and air cover (financially and emotionally) to build towards indie nights/weekends.

Rework is the speed killer. Principle of getting inside OODA loops is similar. You don’t want to necessarily iterate faster than the adversary, you want to operate inside their decision cycle. You might be able to do that while being slower. Knudsen’s big innovation at Chevrolet, which allowed him to beat Ford (in a way beating himself because he set up Ford’s initial leadership) was annual model updates and mass customization of color choices.

However, they cannot stop at being novel. To be innovative, they must also be buildable, and there must be a big enough group of customers that want to and have the ability to buy them.\n\nThe reality is that innovation is hard to do.\n\nInnovation work is fundamentally different from all other types of work because it involves uncertainty both in how to do the work and in what the work is intended to achieve—ie both __how to proceed__ and __what success means__ are inherently uncertain. The inherent uncertainty of innovation work makes it uniquely challenging for large, established corporations because they are organised to execute and optimise an existing repeatable and scalable business model.\n\nMaking big corporations more innovative requires first framing the problems, then identifying the solutions. Corporations hire traditional consulting companies to do this for them all the time. Their problem-framings are usually uninteresting, and their solutions ineffective. One boring obstacle to innovation is simply not having the “right” innovation resources in-house. A boring solution to this problem is mergers and acquisitions (M&A), in which a corporation fuses with or buys another, presumably more innovative, corporation. (This usually doesn’t work.)\n\nA Yak might frame the problem differently and come up with unconventional and more effective solutions. An example of a weirder view might be that large corporations are siloed, and that innovation-relevant goals and skills aren’t mutually legible across silos. A Yak-solution to this problem might be to create a team of part-time employees whose role is specifically to cross silos and make goals/skills legible across the organization—human mRNA.\n\nBetween M&A and human mRNA lies an enormous range of possible problem-framings and solutions.

Third, __innovation__ in big corps means for the majority of its use \"Innovation Marketing\" (= telling your customers you are innovative but you aren't) and/or \"Innovation Theater\" (= telling your employees you are ..., but ... ). So even if you mean it serious, the big corps buying center just uses your content differently. I am totally with Christensen here.

Where people will either remotely access or log in, in a fashion, to an artificial body. If it’s a robot body, or something constructed with synthetic polymers, something like that, in order to reduce the risk of injury to actual human beings. Because I think you’re starting to see that more and more—especially in football players, but in other sports as well—that people are starting to understand that there is a toll that sports takes on a human body. As a society, we have to ask ourselves a question—is this worth it to us in order to be entertained? Is it worth it to us to have people drop dead after a race? Or to be crippled for life in order that we can watch and be entertained?

Let’s say in boxing, when you have people sparring versus during an actual bout, you see quite a bit of differences in terms of punch forces and what is sustained during the fight. So I think having some more of the real-time monitoring of all sports—football, baseball, everything—will provide that instant feedback. That’s kind of what we’re all about now in the world, and in the U.S. specifically, is getting that instant feedback and having those numbers and those metrics right away so you can make decisions.

Korean solo artists and groups borrow from and cite instrumentation and vocals of R&B genres, especially hip hop. They also enhance the R&B tradition by utilizing Korean musical strategies. These musical citational practices are deemed authentic by global fans who function as part of K-pop’s music press and promotional apparatus. K-pop artists also cite elements of African American performance in Korean music videos. These disrupt stereotyped representations of Asian and African American performers.

Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison. In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned.

I started off being an author of several of their reports and speaker at many of their events (I trained as a psychologist and had worked as a research scientist for many years, so I applied these skills to a very quantitative analysis of e-commerce sites - this was in 2004). Then, because of their position as a trusted authority on digital marketing, Econsultancy's subscribers, most of whom worked in big enterprises, started asking for help. 'Do you know anyone who could help with marketing analytics?' 'Who could work with us to re-platform our website?' 'Can you help us make sense of Digital Transformation for our organisation?' Fortunately, for me they didn't have any consultants on their staff so they asked their authors and speakers to consult on their behalf. Econsultancy managed the procurement, set the price (in the early days in discussion with the consultant), managed delivery and then procured consultants to do the work.

I then broadened from digital marketing into marketing and sales. I did a big job for Cisco integrating their marketing and sales teams into a single team.  This then led me into 'Digital Transformation' just as it was becoming a buzz word. This is also potentially big learning for Yak Collective. Identify a rising trend and harness our collective effort to become established as a trusted authority on that topic. We did this very successfully within Econsultancy. Several of us wrote reports on digital transformation and related topics. The Econsultancy team did a great job with SEO, so lots of consultancy requests started to come in. And the more work we did in this area, the more expertise we gained and the greater our lead over competitors became.  In one pitch, the client really wanted to work with one of the big-name consultancies but found that my experience as an individual consultant was greater than the combined experience of all the consultants in their preferred big-name companies (I'd just finished three digital transformation projects with three different clients in the pharma sector).","create-email":"mike@goalatlas.com","create-time":1603889649169,"uid":"Fa_x4X_DW","edit-time":1603889739850,"edit-email":"mike@goalatlas.com"},{"string":"Right now, I am focused on strategy and excited by the prospects it offers me.

Probably in two key ways. Firstly there are lots of tactical changes, like remote working and clients being comfortable to work with a consultant they never meet face-to-face. Secondly, and more strategically, though, it has shifted how organisations see risks. We should have seen the cover pandemic coming. In fact, we did actually see it coming. In 2017 the WHO estimated the risk of a major outbreak of a new virus at 3% per year and the risk of a new viral pandemic at 1% per year. Organisations just didn't plan proportionately to the risk and its impact. So, I believe organisations will start to adopt a much more structured and systematic approach to risk assessment and mitigation.

If you look at a lot of the strategy books out there, they provide 'perspectives' on strategy, so Michael Porter, for example, says strategy is all about competitors and gaining competitive advantage.  Gary Hamel, on the other hand, says strategy is all about building internal capabilities. Both of these are both useful insights (and, of course, both are right) but they don't tell me how to 'do' strategy. Once I've finished writing my strategy, what do I do next?  How do I stop it being left in everyone's desk drawer and forgotten?  How do I make my strategy adaptable? Or agile? How do I check if it is innovative enough?

And we've had a bit of a discussion in Discord about reports (e.g. CB Insights report) that we are approaching the end of strategy. In some ways, I agree. The approach of the big-three consultancies (McKinsey, Bain and BCG) is to take the task of strategy out of their client companies, resolve it and drop it back in as a completed piece of work.  This doesn't often transformationally change anything!.  I'm much ore convinced by the idea that strategy needs to become an in-house capability, we can't just outsource it and get somebody else to do it, and then parachute it back into the organization. That just doesn't work. We've got to develop that discipline expertise in house, because strategy doesn't just live with the senior leadership team.  Strategy is for everyone.

This is not re-packaging McKinsey, Bain or BCG, it's fundamentally different. It is more collaborative, it is more participative. it brings the organisation along on the strategy journey. As a result there is more shared ownership of the strategy and hence more likelihood of transformational change being achieved. This is the stuff that we do. And of course, my argument, because I've just written the workshop manual on it is that we should be focusing on the principles that constitute a process of managing strategy.

Wardley mapping is similar in certain to respects to the strategy mapping that Kaplan and Norton proposed for their Balanced Scorecard, in the 1990s. Balanced Scorecard mapping plots strategic goals across four 'perspectives' - financial, customer, internal and learning-and-growth. The idea here is that strategy for a commercial organisation is ultimately for financial gain. To achieve this financial gain you need to change how you deal with customers. To do this you need to change internal processes and to change internal processes you need to learn and grow as an organisation. This, as a key design feature of the strategy map, suggests you cannot change internal processes to bring about financial gain without going through customers. This is clearly wrong (e.g. improving supply chain management) and is a limitation of this type of strategy mapping. Wardley mapping is also constrained. It explores the value chain delivered by an organisation (from customer need to value proposition) and maps this according to how evolved the organisation's offering is (genesis, custom-offering, product or commodity). Both balanced scorecard mapping and Wardley maps are both a particular type of map, called a topological map. A well understood example of a topological map is the London Underground map, where all stations are show in a grid with connections between them at 90 or 45 degree angles. This is great for travelling by underground but useless for navigating London streets by foot. A topological map is, therefore a map that has been simplified and distorted to serve a particular purpose. As a result it can be constraining or misleading for other purposes.  My frustration with these topological maps led me to develop what I think is less constraining and more representative form of mapping for strategy. It is based on the why:how logic devised for value engineering by Larry Miles in 1947 and elaborated by Charles Bytheway in 2007.

To give you an example of this, I did a bunch of digital transformation projects in a row where I ended up working on something completely different from what the client originally asked me to do.  This required a bunch of soft skills to listen really intently to what the client was asking for and seek clarification, where appropriate. Then I might do a bit of analysis and come back with some questions. After a couple of rounds of this the client had persuaded themselves they'd had a better idea on what I should work on. They hadn't.  I'd nudged them towards that view. But if I'd started that engagement by telling them their brief for me was wrong and I had a better idea, they'd have probably found themselves a different consultant.  These are critical soft skills that I took a while to learn.  Another difference is that as you progress in your consultancy career, you build a bigger and more diverse toolbox of hard skills. In my early days, every problem was a nail and my hammer was the perfect tool to hit it with. Now I can offer half a dozen tools for most problems and see which is best suited to the context and culture of any particular client.

Collective intentionality comes in a variety of modes, including shared intention, joint attention, shared belief, collective acceptance, and collective emotion. Collective intentional attitudes permeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents look after or raise a child, campaign for a political party, or cheer for a sports team. And these attitudes are relevant for philosophers, theoretically minded social scientists, and anthropologists because they play crucial roles in the constitution of the social world. \nIn ^^__joint attention__^^, the world is experienced as perceptually available for a plurality of agents. This establishes a basic sense of common ground on which other agents may be encountered as potential cooperators. \n^^__Shared intention__^^ enables the participants to act in that world together intentionally, in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, and to achieve collective goals. The capacity for shared belief provides us with a common stock of knowledge, and thus with a background against which relevant new information which we may want to share with others becomes salient. \n^^__Collective acceptance__^^ is a central presupposition for the creation of a language, and of a whole world of symbols, institutions, and social status. \n^^__Shared evaluative attitudes__^^ provide us with a conception of the common good. In virtue of this we can reason from the perspective of our groups, and conceive of ourselves in terms of our social identities and social roles. This again enables us to constitute group agents such as business enterprises, universities, or political parties.","create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604683979460,"uid":"cgO6Tfc_X","edit-time":1604684265009,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"},{"string":"![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FMO7erlf6e4.png?alt=media&token=ac06bf23-4494-43ef-a141-b33c5546e5fc)","props":{"image-size":{"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FMO7erlf6e4.png?alt=media&token=ac06bf23-4494-43ef-a141-b33c5546e5fc":{"width":289,"height":null}}},"create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604684334516,"uid":"8o92Yryc9","edit-time":1604684336685,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"}],"uid":"iQ0Tv_PFD","edit-time":1604682522640,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"},{"string":"Attending::","create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604682467388,"children":[{"string":"![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FieIpJ1JVh6.png?alt=media&token=fbdb3071-41be-4f99-8afa-7cdb68f917b0)","props":{"image-size":{"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FieIpJ1JVh6.png?alt=media&token=fbdb3071-41be-4f99-8afa-7cdb68f917b0":{"width":219,"height":null}}},"create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604682485035,"uid":"SYxo9tmm-","edit-time":1604682486853,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"}],"uid":"wwp-Y45QM","edit-time":1604682485038,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"},{"string":"","create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604682527951,"uid":"6uO0UPwRu","edit-time":1604682527951,"edit-email":"j@djinna.com"},{"string":"Comments::","create-email":"j@djinna.com","create-time":1604682467078,"children":[{"string":"[[Grigori

Instead of treating human ‘genius’ as a sort of black box made of magical smartstuff, we can reinterpret it as an explosive expansion of the bag of mechanical-but-cognitive tricks discovered by natural selection over billions of years.
