- ## **Welcome**
- Hello and welcome, aspiring Yak! üêÇ :)
- ## **What Is Yak Collective?**
- Yak Collective is a place for people who are thinking about, or are currently making their living as an indie consultant. #needsupdate 
    - [[Patrick Atwater]] 2/7/22 -- maybe refactor this in the direction of "tinkering our way through the Great weirding"
- ## **What Is This Document?**
- The first thing you should know: the Yak Collective is an__ experimental__ and __loosely-coordinated__ network of independent consultants. It is still very much an active experiment. Read about the Yak Collective‚Äôs origins and why it was formed at the [[About Page]].
- YC operates by a simple [[Code of Conduct]] 
    - We'll figure out rules as we go along, but for now there are only 2 rules. 
        - The improv rule of [Yes, And](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...).
        - The [[Don't Make Us Make A Rule]] rule
    - There are no other rules! A Yak doesn‚Äôt need to be an independent consultant or even an aspiring one to participate and contribute.
- ## **Do's and Don'ts of Yaks**
    - ### **DO **
        - Assume good intentions and will.
        - Consider that this network is self-organized and participant-driven
        - Expect to have to figure things out on your own. Expect to navigate a constant stream of information from disparate voices from all around the globe.
        - Understand that the network is constantly growing and changing (we couldn't write a how-to even if we wanted to!)
        - Think about how to facilitate and contribute to projects & member collaborations.
    - ### **DON'T **
        - expect a central authority figure, unified consensus, or simple how-to for how to participate/engage. 
            - this is not a professional outfit or a single entity! Yaks are here participating, on their own time, for fun and profit, in many discordant and divergent ways. 
- ## **Helpful Hints**
- **Helpful hints** for new Yaks from more experienced Yaks
    - Hang out, ask questions, and orient yourself
        - For general questions, post in #general.
        - If it has to do with one of the scheduled voice chats, post in #voice-meta.
        - Otherwise, pick an appropriate channel and ask away.
        - Thursday voice chat focuses on new member/Yak orientation is also another great place to start.
    - Try to make friends and build collaborative relationships
        - Read and post your intros to the #introductions channel and [[Directory]], interact with members, attend voice chats, slide into DMs, interact on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1257428917616553984), read each other's blogs/newsletters, etc
    - Look for opportunities to participate in chat channels and voice chats
        - Find a list of voice chats on the [[Chat Calendar]] or[ Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bzk5NW00MzE3M2Jwc2xtaGg0OW5tcnA1aTRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
            - The voice chats are a great place to participate and get a sense of some of the pockets of culture in the YC.
            - No voice chat is necessarily representative of the rich network of participants that have joined (and continue to join the Yak Collective), but collaborations are built relationship-by-relationship.
    - Find places to contribute and help ‚Äî this is a self-organized network centered around collaboration and projects.
        - Look through Roam, make helpful edits and perform maintenance
        - Give feedback to proposals [[Projects Directory]]
        - Submit your own proposals! Create a stub in Roam, and discuss those proposals in #collaboration channel on Discord
        - Submit a channel idea in #create-destroy-channels
        - Find people with which to collaborate (see above: Try to make Friends)
        - Look through [[Things We Need]] and [[Internal Volunteer Opportunities]] and participate in #Infrastructure channel and Saturday voice chats
- Help the Yak Collective, help a Yak. 
    - Are you a new Yak still with a question?
        - Drop into #general or an appropriate channel and ask away.
