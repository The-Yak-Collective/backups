- 
- If someone has already asked the question you wanted to ask, simply enter a line break, your name in [[]] format, and "+1"
- 
- ## Questions Begin Here:
- __Example:__
- [[Alex Wagner]]: Whom can I ask for help at Yak Collective?
    - [[Anon E. Maus]]: +1
- [[Damian Stewart]]: Do I already need to be a working “indie consultant” to contribute? (aka please help me calibrate/mitigate my imposter syndrome)
- [[Ben Smith]]: What skills/methodologies have been useful for collaborations so far?
- [[Ben Smith]]: Where is everyone "coming from" intellectually? For example, what percentage of contributors are engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs, artists, hard/life/social scientists?
