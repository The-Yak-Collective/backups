- Prompt::
    - The prompt questions are: 
      - Talking about possible platform for independent business consultants -- is it mostly a "transaction" platform, an "innovation' platform or a 'hybrid' one?
      - Can you identify a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that can potentially increase the value of this platform with each new participant?
- Attending::

    - Would like a similar typology of collectives
    - YakC = Herding cats
    - Seems like a pretty good wrap-up of the questions YakC is working on:
        - > Moreover, all platform companies face the same four business challenges. 
          _ They must choose the key “sides” of the platform (that is, identify which market participants they want to bring together, such as buyers and sellers, or users and innovators).
          _ They must solve a chicken-or-egg problem to jump-start the network effects on which they depend. 
          _ They must design a business model capable of generating revenues that exceed their costs. 
          _ And finally, they must establish rules for using (and not abusing) the platform, as well as cultivating and governing the all-important ecosystem.
    - > Future Platform Trends
        - Trend 1: More hybrid business models.
        - Trend 2: More turbocharged innovation.
        - Trend 3: More industry concentration.
        - Trend 4: More curation and regulation.
    - > Three Emerging Platform Battlegrounds
        - Voice wars: Rapid growth, but chaotic competition.
        - Ride-sharing and self-driving cars: From platform to service.
        - Quantum computers: A next-generation computing platform.
