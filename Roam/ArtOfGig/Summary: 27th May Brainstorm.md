- I guess two banal-but-big conversations would be around:
1. neural data interpretability 
2. sharing neural data to public, private circles   and no-one. Something tells me it wouldn't be the repeat of the ongoing conversation on digital data privacy [[Vinay DÃ©brou]]

- Quotes from experts/principals and highlights
    - **I started a [[Collision Forces Brainstorm]] page. Please add to it.** If enough people choose similar collision forces to work with, we can create a bit of a macro view too. Though collision forces for folkways can be unique to that particular folkway. [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Another random thought: If the Kernel tech becomes mainstream and data becomes publicly available, how would fandom change? Could players attain celebrity/cult status on account of their mental strength, even though their actual performance does not necessarily match up? [[Promise Tewogbola]]
    - Another thing you could think about is... might neurofeedback make new kinds of sports possible? just like the invention of the car also led to auto-racing? 
and I think you can include video games in your scope. Could you command entire virtual armies subconsciously in big war-based video games? maybe integrate the Kernel helment with a VR helmet to create new kinds of "neuroVR games"? esports is already huge [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - "note that there's a strong "trad" trend in zoomers... and movements like tradcath are gaining strong traction. There's a good chance 20 years now will look more like 1880 than sci-fi version of 2040

recommend exploring the # tradcath hashtag on twitter for a sense of what's going on https://twitter.com/hashtag/tradcath?lang=en [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Q: Can we measure a deep state of spiritual experience without actually interrupting it ? For example, in a 20 minute meditation exercise, I usually experience few seconds of deep emotional experience. How do we capture the brain imaging for that particular instance ? [[Siva Swaroop: Religious Ways]]
A: I don't know how bulky the Kernel helmets actually feel, or how much sound/temp they give off, but you can wire somebody up and have them attenuate, and there's lots of EEG meditation studies that seem to work. (Joseph Fridman)
