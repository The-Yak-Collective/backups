- [[Yak Talk]] Newsletter
    - Update from [[Matthew Sweet]] on [[September 24th, 2020]]
        - With the newsletter, we've been trying to build a consistent product that can help to find and establish an external audience, expand it and potentially bring in commissioned projects.
          The plan was to establish three tracks/beats: 
            - trends and futures
            - online governance
            - complexity. 
        - Current status:
            - Initially, we wanted content for each track published each week. That turned out to be a lot, so we scaled back to one a week. Even that, absent preprepared content, proved difficult given the voluntary nature and the need for basically all of us to fit duties around other work/projects. We had semi-established roles a few weeks ago, but now we've seen attrition regarding publishing/involvement. Now, we are considering either recruiting more people to the effort, folding it in and forming the newsletter as an instrument of the infrastructure arm, or just abandoning/handing it off altogether.
            - It's tended to average 500 or so views per edition, an open rate hovering around 50% and a current subscriber base of 330.
- Content Aggregator/Network - YakC Content Network (YCCN)
    - Stage {{or: idea|considering|decided|WIP|done}}
    - Why?
        - How to leverage each Yak's audience/following?
        - Generate traffic to YakC web property
        - Increase awareness and engagement 
    - What?
        - Every Yak content outlet becomes part of the YakC Content Network
            - each outlet/post references/links the network (__part of the YCCN__)
            - has a bloc of suggested network reading (Outbrain style)
        - On top there's a YakC Aggregator - like Techmeme
            - links to network articles
            - original content
    - How?
        - needs some development - although you probably can use a mix of CMS + RSS + Zapier
        - some SEO expertise< might be needed
        - needs a clear pitch to the Yaks - why they should join the YCCN 
    - Potential barriers
        - technical complexity
        - low adoption from Yaks 
    - Project Pitch (draft)
        - Yak Collective Content Network: we have the opportunity to aggregate and leverage the individual audience of each Yak in a way that benefits both individual Yaks and the Collective. By building an interconnected network of content outlets (blogs, newsletters, podcasts,...) that drive and receive traffic/audience to/from a YC content Hub.
