- **Agenda**
    - **0:05 → 0:05 — Music Introductions**
        - Time for people to trickle in + get situated
        - Ask people to check-in with something in the chat
        - Any recommendations for the music?
    - **0:05 → 0:15 — Welcoming + Announcements**
        - Inspired by [[YC Annual Meeting 2020]]
            - A decentralized collective of independent knowledge workers
            - **What it is:**
                - A place to make your indie life more meaningful/fun
                - A production support system to help your side projects come to life, mainly related to knowledge work and associated products
                - An experiment in decentralized organization and work strongly inspired by the open-source world
            - **What it is not:**
                - **A self-conscious political experiment:** we might talk about various economic or political ideologies but we're primarily about interesting projects and getting things done
                - **A "how-to" education space:** you might learn things as a by-product of other activities but this isn't a school for consultants or a mentoring network
                - **A "networking" place to find gigs and leads.** You might find gigs as a side effect of other things (and people have), and there is some limited support, but it isn't a priority
            - **What the Yak Collective does:**
                - Collaborate on projects of mutual interest
                - Form study-groups to learn about a new topic
                - A production sy aimed at recreating itself as a better production platform
        - **Mention some of our most active**
            - **Re-Imagine Healthcare Project** -- A deck aimed at persuasively reframing the debate around US Healthcare and the intangible costs on lost creativity, entrepreneurshiop March 29th at 9pm US East time
            - **Online Governance Studie**s -- a group that discusses ideas about online communities, collectives, networks, and decentralized organization with a somewhat scholarly approach -- our last two explorations were into the concept of Dynamic Capabilities by David Teece, and the concept of Scenius or Communal Genius -- every Friday at 12pm US East time
            - **Philosophy Studies** -- an informal reading group having discussions as inspired by source materials; right now, they're reading Nietzche's Daybreak and considering reading: Jacque Reanciere: Hatred of Democracy, Giorgio Agamben: Sacrament of Language or Renee' Griard's: The Scape Goat -- every Sunday at 9am US East
            - **Infrastructure** -- every Wednesday at 10am US East -- building the systems and technologies that support Yaks in the Yak collective; currently, our focus is on leveling-up our project incubation and project publication capabilities
            - **Yak Coffee** -- "We have a lot of interesting conversations here in the Yak Collective and we're aiming to externalize the same opportunity for potential clients to help cultivate deal flow. Yak Coffee is a project aimed at exploring how it is we can best go about doing that. If you're interested in helping us develop this idea and push the project forward, please join us in the #coffee-with-a-yak channel in the Incubator."
            - **Very nascent NFT-themed project** where we will be mapping possible future scenarios or worlds in speculative fiction activities as actually backed by NFTs -- currently it is a weekly-question, a space where we have timeboxed thematic discussions
            - **Stay tuned to the Discord**; there should be some pretty interesting developments over the next few weeks and months. And we'd love to have you onboard, if you're interested, please message either Jenna Dixon or me, Oliver King, on Discord. We're the seed members of a working group called the Welcome-Squad aimed at improving the internal user experience for all things related to the Yak Collective

        - Anyways, we've gathered here today for our very first Yakathon! The theme for today is the Yak Rover project, the beginnings of an open-source space program we're brewing up here at the Yak Collective Over.
    - **0:15 → 0:45 — Yak Rover Presentations**
    - **0:45 → 1:00 — Q&A / Yaktivity Sorting**
    - **T+1:00 → T+3:00 — Coworking Sessions (Suggestions)**
        - Introduce yourself, the session theme again, and how you'll facilitate as a session leader
        - Welcome everyone and ask each person to introduce themselves + suggestions on how you can spend your time together as effectively as possible (or icebreaker of your choice)
        - Wrap up introductions/feedback and very clearly state what you'd like to get done + how
        - Mention that it will be published on the website; tell participants they can opt-out of being credited and that we'll follow up afterward with some related house-keeping items
        - I'll ping everyone from the main room at +2:30H into the event with a suggestion to start wrapping up -- session leaders should be prepared for debrief:
            - Summarize the work you got done while showing appreciation for individual contributors
            - Talk about the next steps, name any blockers, and wrap up with a call-to-action
    - **3:00 → 4:05 — Debrief**
        - Welcome everyone back and thank everyone for participating
        - If you'd like, please drop a line in the chat with something you found particularly interesting today or anything else you'd to share with the broader group
        - Over the next hour, we'll be hearing from each of our session leaders as they debrief
        - Let's continue our conversation, and start new ones, on the Discord -- looking forward to seeing everyone around
