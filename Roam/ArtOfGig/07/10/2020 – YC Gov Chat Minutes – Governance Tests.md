- ## Discussion
- [[Alex Wagner]]
    - Three buckets: starting and getting projects approved, dealing with grievances, fair use of Yak projects and text from Roam and Discord
- [[Greg Kramer]]
- [[Grigori Milov]]
    - Forming a vision of what Yak can be in 2021.
    - To work towards the vision, we need people who assume leadership roles.
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - What are reasonable expectations people can have coming into YC?
        - "Capacity-building through group projects."
        - Assessing each other's abilities and building trust over time to know who to call on for a possible project.
        - "How to not fail, in one of the __many, many__ organizational failure modes."
        - Visioning is important. Time-boundedness of "what is Yak in 2021?" is a worthwhile thing to think about.
- [[Meredith Noelle]]
    - How to transform a company into a co-op?
        - Skin in the game there, putting this into practice in her own work.
- [[Scott Garlinger]]
    - "Having a model that more or less reflects what's going on"
    - How can we develop the capacity to capitalize of the preexisting and naturally-occurring functions and flows of Yak wrt to governance?
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Some hierarchies are good, especially within the context of project leadership.
    - The actual mystery here is: "how do you get decentralized things to do anything at all?"
        - Visions are artifacts of hierarchically-structured orgs
        - The paradox of vision vs decentralized orgs.
    - The model of international governance: League of Nations' ostensible failures
        - Open source communities are not perfect
    - Computer metaphors:
        - Traditional org: single computer with top-down system. Single operator, single program.
        - Decentralized org: much more distributed, fuzzy, woolly, "herding cats"/chaotic element
    - Possible vision: "figure out the model of this computer"
        - Ship of Theseus fable
        - Creating a "Ship of Theseus" model for Yak Collective
    - Going back around the circle:
        - "I would like the system to be able to have a process for Yaks to able to bring a possible project and specs to Yak Collective
- [[Alex Wagner]]
    - Finding an audience for Yak.
    - Packaging Yak consulting offers to make them legible and available to clients.
- [[Drew Schorno]]
- [[Greg Kramer]]
- [[Grigori Milov]]
    - It's important to measure.
    - We should measure momentum.
    - We can figure this out. This may be one of the most important things to measure at Yak.
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - Are the "itches that we're scratching" salient are they relevant?
        - Working [[Yak-Walk Map]] w [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] has been enlightening about what audiences that YC serves.
        - How to help people see the value of this community, and make it worthwhile for people to invest time and labor?
        - We don't need complete and perpetual unanimity to be successful.
- [[Meredith Noelle]]
    - Making space and opportunities for new Yaks to participate and contribute.
- [[Scott Garlinger]]
    - "Creating a pedagogy that new Yaks can opt in to, but not making it a required catechism."
- [[Venkatesh Rao]]
    - Using this call to socialize the initial thought and set it in motion.
    - "The seed of something that needs to grow into something much more comprehensive."
    - Governance needs to satisfy several requirements
        - This needs to grow into an operating system.
    - Venkat will likely propose an internal project in Fall wrt building this operating system. To complete by March
        - "Here's the computational metaphor and here's the operating manual for this metaphor."
    - Wary of losing sight of the balance between content vs governance
    - We'll be ready to tackle creating the operating system after the next round of projects launched.
        - "Six reports worth of output" vs 10 years and millions of dollars of billing.
- [[Jordan Peacock]]
    - Governance needs to be designed based on "historical vs concurrent" model
        - A community with a higher throughput needs more rigorous(but not necessarily more rigid) processes than a community that produces less content/projects in a given period.
