- prompt: Bleeding edge of NFTs (past projects like Loot)
- contributor: #[[Commits Vortex]]
- One thing that is interesting with NFTs is the potential for the composition of them to change over time based on various dynamics such as transaction history, geo-location, time of engagement, etc. The fact that they are digital assets that are connected to a particular addresses use cases gives them some greater degree of bespoke adaptability. I've been thinking about this a fair bit in terms of approaches to music -- looking at things like [Async Art](https://async.art/music) and [DeafBeef](https://www.deafbeef.com/about.htm)'s generative audio work. While researching this, Don Hoffman's [[Corruption(s*)]] series, and the new music publishing and selling protocol [Nina](https://nina.market/faq), I came across Charged Particles.  
- Charged Particles is exploring advanced possibilities with NFTs. It might be interesting for Yak Collective to think about what kind of temporal qualities a piece of writing might have. Perhaps the content or presentation of the writing could change according to organization seasons, or be reactive to readership or contributor interactions. One could also imagine applications where after achieving some physical goal, some part of an NFT is revealed. This could be particularly relevant for the Yak Rover project. 
- Charged Particles is more focused on the DeFi side of experiments with NFTs, but some of these ideas could be speculatively extrapolated into dimensions that intersect with the collective's interests. 
    - > - Turn your favorite NFT into a Goal-Based interest earning Piggy bank. The accumulating interest inside of your NFT changes the image of the artwork as time progresses. Visually seeing your goal-based savings account transforming closer and closer to that goal.  The NFT image would change based on the amount of charge and helps people visualize what they’re saving for, e.g. the NFT’s image could be a gray car that turns into a colored-in one as you get closer to your goal.
      
      - Music NFT: A Meta “Album” NFT filled with (time-locked) individual songs NFTs that have customizable release conditions
      
      - Token-Gated Access Newsletters / Chats — Incorporating the accumulated interest (‘charge’) aa NFT has — incorporating this ‘proof of length of NFT ownership’ mechanic quite beautifully.
      
      - Financial-themed Art. Used for financial communities. Think of a beautifully designed 100 LINK Bill filled with 100 LINK worth of aLINK growing interest over time.
      
      - Charity-Focused Art Sales. Portion of interest-generated (CHARGE) always pays out to charity (or any ETH address).
      
      -Patreon-Style Donations. Fans can deposit tokens into an artist’s NFT. The artist’s NFT (pre-sale) can be accruing donations before being sold in the open market.
      
      - Particle with link to Physical Art. Think about having a Particle that is linked to a physical artwork, generating charge internally, giving a percentage to charity/museum. The charity/museum element would be a much more interest-ing and accessible thing for someone non-crypto-native to appreciate the digital ‘core’ of the piece. Rather than just looking at a jpeg, they’re looking at a piece of functional technology that is generating good in the world while it sits on the wall.
      
      - Virtual Geocaching. Treasure hunts for hidden NFTs in the Metaverse! When you find it you get to discharge the accrued interest and leave your name. The NFT stays for the next person to find… the longer it takes, the more accumulated interest (charge) to gain!
      
      - Transfer collections of tokens in a single transaction (ERC721 Transfer). FIll up your NFT with a basket of other tokens. This basket is easily transferable, could be used as a trust as the contents can be timelocked.
      
      - Entertainment NFTs — a basket of trading cards based on Celebrities who have social tokens, and the NFTs contain some amount of their token
