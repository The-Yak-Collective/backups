    - __Format__
        - The first goal of the project is to create an experimental slide deck similar to [[The New Old Home]]
        - The second goal of the project is to create an experimental zine based on the first deck, with digital and print copies optional to order. It would feature long form blog posts based on the first goal with project samples, prototypes, interviews with homesteaders, photos, sketches. 
- **SEEDS**: These are starting points for exploring the topic that can be shared with fellow Yak to generate interest, jumpstart their thinking, and define the potential scope of the project contents. To be shared at point of launching project & collecting contributors. Rough notes can be found in [[The New Old Country]] and [[The New Old Country: Lenses]].
