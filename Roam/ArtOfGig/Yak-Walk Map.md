- A walk-through map with major covid-19 induced pain-point-clusters as junctions/stopovers. Every junction has a pain-point cluster along with curation and linking of actionable resources. Primary filter to shape the content scope is rapid-actionability.
- This map aims to lay out a practical 'handholding' trail (or more than one?) for a potential client (a decision-making leader in an organization needing external help to navigate one or more critical pain-point). The POV of the map is a decision-maker(CXO, VP, Head of Department) struggling to deal with new landscape. 
- Cognitive Flow of Reader: 
    - Identify my critical pain-point -> "What do I do about it?" 
    - -> Point to a actionable framework -> "What do I do about it?" 
    - -> Point to credible resources(people that can help me implement this, software I need to use, guides I need to skim)
    - ------Beyond Yak-Walk Map territory-------
    - -> "How do I put this together into a gig that could solve this pain-pointfor me?"  ---- YC gig organization: [[Venkatesh Rao]] is leading an evolving discussion on this in the Discord server. 
    - A basic system to help in the assembly of a project's team using the existing Yak Collaborators Directory

- I still need to expand on these! ^^ [[Alex Wagner]]
- [[Vinay DÃ©brou]] will be co-leading this. Another co-lead and contributors needed. A voice-chat (on Discord) will be scheduled to discuss the initial shape of this on Wednesday, May 6th 2020 at 9am Pacific Time.
