# Purpose
    - Member database (future website release)

    - Members: [https://yak.knack.com/yaks[yak-profile](<yak-profile.md>)/](https://yak.knack.com/yaks[yak-profile](<yak-profile.md>)/)
    - Share login: [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) | [Jordan Peacock](<Jordan Peacock.md>) 
    - Alternate Builder access as needed: [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) | [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>)

## [Schema | member data](<Schema | member data.md>)
Note that the functionality represented by the member data files will eventually be subsumed into [Knack](<Knack.md>).

- The following front matter attributes are allowed in member data files, but should seldom, if ever, be included. There is probably no reason to implement them in [Knack](<Knack.md>).
