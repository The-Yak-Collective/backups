# Purpose
    - Member database (future website release)
        - Minimal information from [Discord](<Discord.md>) (server name, user ID, role data) will be moved over using a `yak_shaver` bot. May or may not commit info to [GitHub](<GitHub.md>) along the way.

## [Contributing to the Website](<Contributing to the Website.md>)
- Work on migrating member data to [Knack](<Knack.md>).

## [GitHub](<GitHub.md>)
- Currently holds member data; plan is to migrate this to [Knack](<Knack.md>)

## [IT Infrastructure](<IT Infrastructure.md>)
- [Knack](<Knack.md>)

## [Schema | member data](<Schema | member data.md>)
- [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) says: Using the `firstname-lastname` format makes sense at first and provides for pretty URLs, but it makes handling name-changes harder than it should be. Experience in the $dayjob says that we __will__ eventually run into problems using this as an ID. So long as YC is small, we can probably work around things with redirects... But if I was going to implement this today (or reimplement it in [Knack](<Knack.md>))
