# Yaks
    - Anyone who is a member of the YakC Discord server or who has made a significant contribution to a YakC project is considered a "yak". There are four "types" of yaks.
    - ## New Yaks
        - __New yaks__ are people who have joined the YakC Discord server, but who have not yet posted an introduction.
        - New yaks who do not post an introduction within 1 week of joining are culled from the herd.
    - ## Active Yaks
        - All yaks who have at least made an introduction on the YakC Discord server are considered __active yaks__.
        - Active yaks may participate in YakC projects and, if they desire, are eligible for inclusion on the [Yak Network Map](<Yak Network Map.md>).
    - ## Made Yaks
        - __Made yaks__ have made a significant contribution to a YakC project.
            - Such project can be externally facing (__e.g.__, [The New Old Home](<The New Old Home.md>)) or internally facing (__e.g.__, [YC Marketing - distributed CMO](<YC Marketing - distributed CMO.md>)).
            - Ideally, __all__ projects should be featured on the [Yak Collective Website](<Yak Collective Website.md>). As of [November 9th, 2020](<November 9th, 2020.md>), only externally facing projects are currently featured, but [this needs to be fixed](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective/issues/29).
        - The elevation to made yak is determined by the lead editors of the project that yak contributed to. All made yaks should be listed in a project's credits.
            - Occasionally, a made yak may be someone from outside of the YakC Discord server if that person has made significant contributions to a YakC project. __This should be the exception, rather than the rule.__
        - If they desire, made yaks are eligible for inclusion on the [Yak Network Map](<Yak Network Map.md>).
    - ## Yak Shavers
        - __Yak shavers__ are YakC Discord server admins.
        - If they desire, yak shavers are eligible for inclusion on the [Yak Network Map](<Yak Network Map.md>).
