    - [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
        - Kick off
            - Common knowledge is being disrupted now due to change in social conventions e.g. handshakes to show mutual recognition. 
            - Online gov call can not assume common knowledge due to different subset of people joining weekly. 
    - [Alex Wagner](<../../Alex Wagner.md>)
        - How to create a culture of "no stupid questions" 
        - Paper about Internalized Paranoia in Academia being a highly combative environment which is internalized so when they join a group they are afraid of asking questions. (https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/Y8k1Ln/10.4324-9780203699997-7.pdf)
    - [Claire Peters](<../../Claire Peters.md>)
        - Common knowledge as explanation for political speech being a variable in political decision-making and outcomes
    - [Grigori Milov](<../../Grigori Milov.md>)
        - Difficult to have common knowledge within 500 person group with only dozen participants at any given time 
        - Especially as the dozen participants involved in different projects 
        - Participate in learning channel though it's no longer active 
    - [Jordan Peacock](<../../Jordan Peacock.md>)
        - Greetings in Kuwait is very diverse due to a large expat community so Jordan learned to defer to the other person to initiate greeting 
        - Work with clients lean into their norms unless there's a strong reason to disagree 
        - Has trouble setting norms which bothers others as some are very opinionated while others bristle at adherence in norms which is a shared common knowledge issue 
        - notes strict vs. variable normative framework as a possible point of focus
    - [Kacper Wikiel](<../../Kacper Wikiel.md>)
        - Common Knowledge easier to create in physical space where you can read from the other people faces & voice. 
    - [Praful Mathur](<../../Praful Mathur.md>)
        - Discuss the effect of newsletter as the way to set up common knowledge for larger groups 
    - [Sachin Benny](<../../Sachin Benny.md>)
        - Medium sets the complexity of sharing common knowledge memes vs movie as commitment changes by medium 
        - some memes need much more common knowledge than two hour long movies 
        - Venkat added - can we use memes as a way to build common knowledge
    - [Scott Garlinger](<../../Scott Garlinger.md>)
        - Scott follows Sachin and is closely followed by Venkat during calls which is similar to McKinsey during their social events and having different norms 
        - Quests? 
        - 
    - [Siva Swaroop](<../../Siva Swaroop.md>)
        - Collective output of the community 
        - Not much output right now with quality
        - Set up common knowledge standards for quality 
        - Similar to markets ?
        - 
    - [Sterling Proffer](<../../Sterling Proffer.md>)
        - YC is not a binary org whether you're in or you're out, its opt-in, communication is feed-based so has characteristic of ephemerality and some notes are stored in Roam 
        - Strength in connections and have to know what data is push vs pull 
        - How to create mechanisms for what should become common and how that changes based on strength of relationship to YC 
        - Find ways to programatically surface common knowledge similar to how GPT-3 examples have been surfacing on Twitter last 48 hours 
    - [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
        - Re: Jordan's comments about expectations -- how do you read and set expectations of those joining YC e.g. job holders vs people can deal with more ambiguity. Expect twitter vs top-down hierarchy. 
        - Alex talked about Newsletter & Sachin discussed memes as real-time movie. How can we use Meme to set common knowledge. Yak is a meme that came from Art of Gig and people joining have no idea about that joke though understand the motif e.g. Yak Poop, etc. 
        - Siva mentioned market mechanisms where 1 project is completed and half-assed approach with Yak Coin. 3 mechanisms: newsletter, Coin, and projects. 
        - Siva & Venkat are running final frontier so want to understand how the common knowledge will effect project over time 
        - From last call still developing computing metaphors to governance such as CAP Theorem, Distributed Computing, Map/Reduce, ... 
    - [Alex Wagner](<../../Alex Wagner.md>)
        - People joining are asking "What are the norms?", replies with ?? 
    - [Jordan Peacock](<../../Jordan Peacock.md>)
        - Proactively asking questions re: "What are norms?" 
        - How to bring commercial projects? Discussed work that [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>) and him did to bring Neurofuturama to fruition using precedent as a framing device 
        - Take a Gig/Leave a Gig has discussion about bringing Nuerofuturama to life: https://discordapp.com/channels/692111190851059762/692816049678057544/733411788745474067
    - [Sterling Proffer](<../../Sterling Proffer.md>)
        - Required marketing funnel to understand ?? due to friction in steps of getting the right information
        - Understanding YC is navigating a dark room without a flashlight and wonder if others are wearing night vision ridiculing you 
        - YC is nice with "No dumb questions" despite the staggering amount of collective intelligence 
        - Self-directed onboarding to gain more common knowledge
    - [Alex Wagner](<../../Alex Wagner.md>)
        - YC is one large emergent text, applying Von Tan's sociology post: org with hard boundary vs org with diffuse boundary (https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/31-alternative-sociality)
        - Bible with 7 layers of meaning and foreground the initial meaning with self-directed to deeper meanings 
    - [Sachin Benny](<../../Sachin Benny.md>)
        - Projects operate the mechanic of finding self-direction and different meanings
        - 
    - [Sterling Proffer](<../../Sterling Proffer.md>)
    - A minimum of signaling of __what YC actually is__, would go a long way
    - [Siva Swaroop](<../../Siva Swaroop.md>)

    - [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
        - "If I had to pick one piece of common knowledge to focus on installing:"
            - "If you want to learn what Yak Collective is, go join a project."
            - The experience of participating in a project is probably the most rapid way of installing common knowledge of Yak.
            - Or start a project.
- 
- Q. What do we need to add to establish appropriate expectations for people coming in cold?
- Recommendation: Some kind of FAQ ("so I want to do X; where do I start?"); we're building it out in [Onboarding for New Yaks](<../../Onboarding for New Yaks.md>), merging in information from [Yak Collective FAQ](<../../Yak Collective FAQ.md>)
