    - Is the central question here, [How do we plan for the complete lifecycle of Yak, without inventing psychohistory?](<../../How do we plan for the complete lifecycle of Yak, without inventing psychohistory?.md>)
- [Grigori Milov](<../../Grigori Milov.md>)
    - Not a fan of the BDFL model. Sometimes conflict resolution is better handled in a simpler, less personal way, such as flipping a coin, even.
- [John Grant](<../../John Grant.md>) 
    - Not-for-profit orgs need a BDFL to succeed
- [Johnicholas Hines](<../../Johnicholas Hines.md>)
    - Seasteading people, the ideal of competition between multiple different nations. As long as you can "vote with your feet", this works. Open source patterns another example of this working.
- [Jordan Peacock](<../../Jordan Peacock.md>)
    - Part of the challenge is for the BDFL and team to create self-perpetuating systems/checks/balances/protocols.
- [Lydia Laurenson](<../../Lydia Laurenson.md>)
    - Problems with BDFL seem kind of obvious. Are all BDFLs doomed to fail?
    - Interested in the theoretical aspects of community building.
- [Sachin Benny](<../../Sachin Benny.md>)
    - Sometimes the org is shaped and crystallizes around the BDFL and core team, so that org becomes less adaptable, and eventually fails.

    - Thoughts on inhabiting BDFL role:
        - "Fact is, groups form around individuals and their ideas... Things don't get invented by committees."
        - "The people most qualified to do the BDFL job are the ones who are the least interested(and vice versa)"
        - Two examples in exiting the role – One successful; one, a "question mark"
            - Refactor Camp facebook groups: Venkat was admin, succeeded in leaving by instigating elections for admins to take over.
            - Refactor Camp irl: Was unable to find others to run the conference year-after-year. No way to perpetuate the conference without stable leadership.
        - Creating a "community of one" online
        - Knowing how not to fail, is not the same as knowing how to succeed
        - **"Three problems that I see here"**
            - 1. Simple backstopping. All of the admin and production work needs to be effectively, efficiently delegated, because the sheer volume of work is more than a BDFL can handle.
            - 2. Shared sense of values and taste. "The community's sense of taste about work and activities."
                - If this is not shared, community suffers an "aesthetic unraveling".
            - 3. The mechanics of transferring authority from:
                - A. A person to a process. Automating a community job.
                - B. A person to another person. One person transferring community power
                - "Incumbency effect"
- [Vinay Débrou](<../../Vinay Débrou.md>)
    - 1. One heuristic: there's a point where a system is worth building, depending on how much work the system will be able to take on from the person or group.
    - 2. W/r/t making labor legible. Can be other than monetary. Status, etc.
