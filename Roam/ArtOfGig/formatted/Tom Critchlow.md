I think the key things writing (i.e. blogging) gives you is: a) an awareness that you're "for hire" and b) what projects you would be a good fit for. You're basically looking to maximise the number of people who could make a good intro for you when an opportunity arises. [Tom Critchlow](<Tom Critchlow.md>)

- Reading this made me think that the peacetime/wartime CEO analogy is not right for indies... What are the modes indies can drop into? What should be the mindset change during these times for indies? - [Tom Critchlow](<Tom Critchlow.md>)
