- **Objective:** Create a Yak Job Board
- 
- ## Brain Dump
    - List jobs in [Yak Talk](<Yak Talk.md>) newsletter?
    - Spreadsheet with 3-5 volunteers maintainers/people who post jobs?
        - How to curate quality jobs/gigs?
            - What is the incentive for folks to maintain the board and post jobs?
                - Yak coin?
                    -  When will Yak Coin be worth something?
                        - Crazy idea: What if all Yaks chipped in a nominal fee per month, and that backed Yak Coin?
    - What is the primary engine of job boards?
        - Recruiters get paid by hiring co's
        - On job board platforms, hiring co's pay monthly SaaS subscription, or per listing
