- The marriage of [User Centered Design](<User Centered Design.md>)  with [Positive Psychology](<Positive Psychology.md>) 
    - [User Centered Design](<User Centered Design.md>) discipline
        - originated with man-machine [ergonomics](<ergonomics.md>) using mostly psychophysics (reaction times, just noticeable differences, speed vs accuracy)
        - Renamed [Human-Computer Interaction](<Human-Computer Interaction.md>) because computers are very special machines

                - Make or break dimensions have such a fine granularity that separates similar implementations (e.g. Zune vs iPod)
        - [Positive Psychology](<Positive Psychology.md>) is not actually a discipline, so much as an orientation
            - Shifts focus from pathology to optimization 
                - e.g., [Csikszentmihalyi](<Csikszentmihalyi.md>) studied [Flow](<Flow.md>)

            - Guiding Assumption: The power of [situation](<situation.md>) to influence behavior. [Behavioral Economics](<Behavioral Economics.md>) labels this the [framing](<framing.md>), and it's often more potent than knowledge of the facts
- High quality evidence exists in pockets, yet there's no path to accumulate validated knowledge as the crisis normalizes
    - [Evidence Based Design](<Evidence Based Design.md>) has lots of usable guidelines, BUT
    - [Soft infrastructure](<Soft infrastructure.md>) is too frequently neglected. Many [behavioral problems](<behavioral problems.md>) are poorly addressed by technological solutions 
    - [Behavioral Economics](<Behavioral Economics.md>) is all about the gap between knowledge and action
        - DIY hackers proliferate [McGyver](<McGyver.md>) innovations 
        - Marketplace will be crowded with non-factual claims
        - Corporations can benefit from providing packaged solutions to their home office workers
- What Yak Collective could contribute
    - Evolve an Aeron Chair for the mind
        - Also a Bicycle for the body of that worker
        - A dojo or temple for the Spirit
    - Step 1: Review and taxonomize hacks that address any of the following:
        - Noise and sound control
        - Biophilia in the presence of nature
        - Ritual spacing and control of intent
        - Privacy enhancement
        - e-Sociable milieus
    - Step 2: Develop packaged solutions that incorporate best approach to modifying the [Built environment](<Built environment.md>),
        - Packaged solutions could be post-facto analyzed in terms of variance across independent factors
            - Crucial variable: Behavioral adoption of the [Soft infrastructure](<Soft infrastructure.md>)
        - Further iterations, based on earlier experiments, could converge on fully manufactured
