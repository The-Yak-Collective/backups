- a multidisciplinary exploration in homes of the present & near future (probably a deck?)
- topics could include: 
    - working from home, 
        - broadly construed - logistics, mindset, popularity, necessity, etc
    - consumption patterns - brands that win and lose from neodomesticity
    - family/children, 
    - architecture/interior design, 
    - how commute/lack thereof affects people, 
    - 
- 
    - 1. **Involves an incremental advance in our coordination capability/workflow** - yes, I will try to coordinate to high standards!
    - [1:55 PM]
    - 2. **Topic big firms are unlikely to touch** - yes, a little wacky 
    - 3. **Can accommodate as many contributors as possible** - the more the merrier
    - 4. **Is actionable/operationalizable by orgs so we have something to actually try to sell/pitch** - semi-actionable to WFH companies, maybe interesting to some brands, and possible [leanin](<leanin.md>) feminist grift angle ;) 
- I [Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>) plan to contribute something about [The New Old Home](<The New Old Home.md>): a stylized history of how work used to be in the home, then it traveled out with the male breadwinner, now back again - but obviously things are much different. It's not clear that the New Old Home offers the benefits of either the Old Home (tangible labor) or the New Home (consumption-heavy, production-lite).
- If you are interested in contributing something related to home, its zeitgeist, its discontents, etc please register that interest here with even just 1 sentence about your prospective contribution:
    - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>): Domesticy cozy as an ethos
    - [Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>): Mythical home-work – a roleplaying guide for work at home
    - [Buster Benson](<Buster Benson.md>): Living at home in mythic mode. 
    - [Benjamin P Taylor - London](<Benjamin P Taylor - London.md>) I'm interested in this one - how about 'interruptions and synchronicity' over time (I have to get BBC Man in somehow) OR how about 'colonialism is fundamentally about creating a division, declaring one side better than the other, and using that as the basis for oppression and extractive manipulation', the New Old Home cancels that bullshit and shows what is really work and what's merely status massage (meme of the scene where Don Draper invents the 'executive account')
    - [Toby Shorin](<Toby Shorin.md>): I want to talk about the home as productive force, and what it produces. We already have the language to talk about multiple types of labor, but now that (for many families) *all labor* is taking place in the home, the home itself is becoming a crucial site of economic activity and production. Labor networks *between homes* are now forming and will soon become important engines of wealth and cultural production. I want to speak to these coming changes affect business, culture, etc.
    - [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>): would love to help out on the “labour travelling out with male breadwinner“ angle, or wherever else an extra brain might help - additional research, writing, proofreading, whatever is needed.
        - alternatively, something about labour vs playbour: if BigTechCos make work more like play, so that employees don’t want to/don’t need to go home, this blurs the work/play distinction, but in doing so reinforces home as the place of play, not of work. (might come back with a one sentence snappy description later.)
    -  [Thomas Hollands](<Thomas Hollands.md>): Id be interested in doing a couple slides on which brands/sectors are winning/losing from 2 things:
        - 1. Our days used to be organised around outside demands like commuting to work, picking up kids from school. Now we organise around internal demands like the need to workout at home, a daily-walk, baking bread etc -- mind-clearing replacements for the daily commute.
        - 2. We organise sociality around activites -- and these activites are vastly different due to social distancing. Importance of quizzes, virtual bake-offs and arts n crafts, coordinated individual activities (like virtual yoga) mediated by video calls
            - Social distancing means every relationship is long-distance which makes true long distance relationships relatively easier to maintain
        - Would love to work on this with someone but can also do it on my own
    - [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>): notes on the literal design specs of homes, utilization of space, a new old pattern language: home office, home gym, family spaces, decompression from parenting spaces, creative work spaces, etc. 
        - https://www.autonomous.ai/zen-work-pod 
        - single family homes have new relevance 
        - moving away from cities
        - [A New Old Pattern Language](<A New Old Pattern Language.md>)  is my new stand-in notetaking page for my module
            - open to collaborating with [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>) if he opts-in
    - [Michael Colin](<Michael Colin.md>): Would like to add on to the topic of home design / architectural choices, specifically with a historical comparison of how Tuberculosis impacted aesthetic choices in architectural modernism.
    - [Scott Garlinger](<Scott Garlinger.md>) My contribution will diagram and extrapolate Helen Hester's and Nick Srnicek’s work on social reproduction via housing projects in the early-mid 20th century (Frankfurt, Vienna & Stockholm. I will add my own notes about Chicago’s housing disasters, too). Then, I will speculate what could be for social reproduction’s future. This will be projective, hopeful rather than predictive. 
    - [Alex Dobrenko](<Alex Dobrenko.md>): I'd love to contribute to this with some ideas and examples of 'the homes of modern artists' - I know a whole lot who would be down to share. 
    - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>): I'd like to riff off of the idea of "third space design" in architecture (where space 1 is where you live, 2 is where you work, and 3 is where you like to spend your time). "[One Lousy Space](<One Lousy Space.md>)" 
    - [Tom Critchlow](<Tom Critchlow.md>): I'd like to explore **Visible Knowledge Work**. Pre-pandemic knowledge work was largely invisible to partners and children. We went to work with a laptop and returned with a laptop. The work is intangible. But with everyone WFH - the home becomes a porous space where knowledge work bleeds out. Reports printed on the family printer, zoom calls overheard. I'd like to explore how this changes the power dynamic for families.
