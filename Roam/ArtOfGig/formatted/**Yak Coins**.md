- Yak coins is the name of the proto-blockchainy Yak Collective internal currency project.
- There is currently a live experiment running in the form of a Google Form. You can participate by giving people Yak Coins according to the experiment rules. Here is the link: [Yak coins google-form preliminary experiment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXiaybr43MHEzqdJ9X8T5n6ECi_39lJWpGjDEwduIY1jY8BA/viewform)
- **goal**: gather experimental data for a possible yak-coin scheme

**experiment**: run a peer-recognition coin-transaction scheme on google forms+simple zapier integration: https://forms.gle/CDK454BWxC9xnpQK9

**status**:  live... try playing with this. You have a budget of 5 y$ per month, and you have to track your balance yourself. You can give anyone any amount, subject to your running balance limit of 5 y$/mo and whatever others give you. We'll run validation later to cancel tx that go above but try not to make mistakes please. Form collects email and sends you receipt, and also posts a message in the discord [yakcoin-log](<yakcoin-log.md>) channel. 

**NOTE**: TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY... the data may be used to actually design a real coin scheme later, so don't make goofy transactions. Pretend this is for real.
