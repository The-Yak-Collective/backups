- **CFP stage** — yak collective members submit proposals on a rolling monthly deadline by making proposal pages that are open to comments/feedback. It is up to the proposers to seek out the right kind of feedback to improve their projects. Going forward, this will **be the first Friday of every month**. Next few dates are: **May 8, July 3, Aug 7, Sep 4, Oct 2.**
- **Ranking/Opt-in Stage**: In an open process (google form based), all yak collective members will be able to express interest in contributing. **This is not a vote**. It is an expression of interest in and commitment to contributing, subject to the proposer’s criteria. All members can only opt-in to TWO projects, with a preference ranking of 1, 2.
- **Stack-ranking stage**: The top two proposals are greenlit. Proposals with less than 3 contributors opting in are cut from the list. The rest can stay on the list if they choose, for up to 2 more cycles without modification. After 3 cycles, if they haven’t been greenlit, they are axed as well. The proposers are encouraged, but not required, to keep evolving the proposal in the background. If principals want to, they can begin speculative execution without being greenlit.
- **Execution sprint**: Top 2 proposals (in terms of number of opt-in contributors weighted by preference order) go off on a 2-week execution sprint. **They MUST deliver a release candidate by the last day of the month.** Failure to do so will result in the principals being banned from submitting future proposals for the next 3 cycles.
- **Release decision**: A volunteer panel comprising 2 contributors from the project and 2 non-contributors from previous projects reviews the release candidate and **by consensus** decides on one of 4 options:
    - Release the project as final, with expectation of full collective marketing push
    - Release as a public beta, with soft marketing push, and expectation of future versions via greenlighting of a follow-on sprint. There is no limit to number of follow-on sprints being greenlit.
    - Treat as internal release and greenlight a follow-on  sprint. There is no limit to number of follow-on sprints being greenlit.
    - Decide it’s going nowhere and axe it as a YC project. Contributors are of course welcome to pursue as a non-YC project. If no consensus can be reached, this is the default option. Fail fast.
- **Culling**: To prevent proliferation of projects, no contributor may work on more than 2 projects at once, or lead more than 1 project at a time. If the number of in-flight active projects grows past 10, the oldest projects are axed. This will create a bias in favor of projects that take fewer sprints to finish. Culling should't be seen as failure. Rather it is likely that long-running projects that don't launch after many sprints are simply too big for the yak collective to sponsor/incubate, and should fork off on their own.
