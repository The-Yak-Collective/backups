    - ## Soothing agitation in dementia & delirium
        - My initial hook in Age Ways is considering how neuroscience could be used to detect behavioural changes in people with dementia, delirium, or Alzheimers to detect early signals of agitation and respond by playing familiar music as an alternative to medical interventions that prevents escalation to aggressive behaviours
        - That makes sense! I could imagine that with widespread monitoring, we might begin to pathologize & preempt forms of mild atrophy that are considered normal, non-pathological effects of aging on the brain too. [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)

    - ## Access the wisdom of the ages
        - A sort of time capsule, where you record a version of yourself (say every 7 years), plus a range of different possible future yous (synthesised from recordings of older people who held a similar neuro-profile at your age). Expands our sense of self from the present to extend into the past and the future, and honours the different people you have been over your life and may yet become. This could be a personal oracle you access at critical milestones and when making significant decisions

                - When someone dies in their youth, data from older people with a similar neuro-profile are synthesised to create a digital approximation of that person that matures and ages alongside their peers

    - ## Neurological memento mori
    - One of my own strong interests is in time perception, and one of the fascinating things about aging is that there are clear differences in how older people think versus younger based on the perceived time-left-to-live horizon (see Linda Cartensen research at Stanford). Young people end up with the same "old" time horizon attitudes when diagnosed with a terminal illness, or caught up in war or pandemic or other conditions where the future seems foreshortened. So if you can __artificially__ create this foreshortened horizon effect with neural techniques you'd have a neurological [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) tech [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

    - ## External memory
        - “Christina, you’ve asked me to remind you when you forget peoples’ faces. This is David, your son’s son, the last time you saw him was after he was born three months ago. I can replay how you reacted if you would like.” was something I wrote for Death Ways design fiction that I think has large crossover with aging ways [Shreeda Segan: Death Ways](<Shreeda Segan: Death Ways.md>)

    - Experiment I'd like to run using Kernel sound ID + (some kind of emotion sensing mechanism): Integrate with spotify/music player and observe user activity before/after certain types of emotional states and the effect of music on emotional states.
Similar to this non-invasive neurotech product that exists for guided mediation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(headband)
Description: Bio-feedback to calm the mind, identify stressed/depressed states, play relevant music, testing reactions to certain kinds of music. Using stress patterns/signals and common music activity to recommend new music/appropriate music for relaxation [Link to Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/712459471787393054/714529269220507668)
    - Imagine wearing a kernel helmet long enough that all your experiences record both on your own brain AND on an external data store. Later, you "playback" the data store on a different brain somehow... to provide access to the memories. Could be sensory (flash images in front of eyes of new person) rather than direct stimulation of brain, which I'm skeptical will get that far along to implant memories and such. 
Much like a pensieve. This could also be useful for increasing QoL for people with neurodegenerative diseases. [Link to Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/712459471787393054/714921650872647753)
    - What if we could factor out the effects of aging on the brain, and apply that filter to your current  thoughts? I.e. what would your future self say to your current self? [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)
