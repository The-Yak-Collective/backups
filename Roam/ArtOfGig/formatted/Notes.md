## [Project Pitches](<Project Pitches.md>)
- **Comments:** I've already done 70% of the work on this project (see [the quadrantology website](https://quadrantology.com)). I've designed and validated the personality test and underlying theory, designed and play-tested a set of game assets, and trialled a version of the online personality test using typeform and Matlab based test processing. I'd assign a license to YC to develop it into a revenue-generating asset, with royalties for me as creator of the underlying IP and some sort of residuals scheme (tbd) for people who participate in the project to get it live and maintain it.
