- **Description:** Mentor-facing doc for leading Yak newbie chats. Yak newbie chats are typically 30-minutes. The point of the chat is not to walkthrough the onboarding doc, but rather to do proper expectation-setting for New Yaks, as well as gather questions from New Yaks.
    - New Yaks are encouraged to practice **self-organized, learner-directed** efforts at self-education on consulting skills. [See here.](https://discordapp.com/channels/692111190851059762/692111190851059766/709465453642383421)

- **Expectation-setting: **
- Yak Collective is for those that aspire to, or are currently practicing the indie consultant lifestyle. To contribute, the best mentality is to approach Yak participation as sort of an ad-hoc, open source-style collective that allows you to connect with like-minds and propose project ideas, within the context of Yak Collective.
- **Surface Your Uncertainty**: Don't be afraid to ask questions about content or context, or to offer half-baked ideas to see if they are fully bakeable, or to sound out opinions on whether something makes sense. Whenever I've done so I've found people have been polite and generous and helpful, encouraging me when I get things right and gently nudging me in the right direction when I get things wrong. It's been a great strategy for me to explore what I know and what I do not know (and also, what I think I know that I actually don't know), and to learn things from that.
