- [**Yak Coins**](<**Yak Coins**.md>) experiment w/ google form + zapier to discord [yakcoin-log](<yakcoin-log.md>) + keep track of your own balance   https://forms.gle/CDK454BWxC9xnpQK9
- design ideas/principles
    - balance out gamification incentive/disincentives
        - Internal only?
            - Weird, barter micro-economy 
        - non-[Blockchain](<Blockchain.md>) perhaps
    - two tiers?
        - social currency vs transactional currency  
    - strong proof-of-work metaphors ? 
        - "One thought I had was that every voice chat mines coins in proportion to the number of people who attended, so 5 people in a 10 minute chat = 5 yak coins mined for eg. It's a proxy for growth in trust levels and takes actually non-fake participation to create. Similarly for collaborative output. 25 people contributing 2 slides each to a deck = say 50 yakcoins create" [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
    - technology expressions:
        - [Blockchain](<Blockchain.md>)
            - [Aragon](<Aragon.md>) / dandelion organization 
            - if going the blockchain wrote, I [Greg Docter](<Greg Docter.md>) can see what ConsenSys folks might have to offer here (either in terms of insight or tooling itself)
        - physical yak coin
            - coming back to the idea of a physical yak coin, still interested? I'd happy foot the bill for the first run of 100 if we can get to a design that's yak-approved

            - challenge coins
