- Basically, don't do anything so blatantly stupid or malicious that it would likely be disallowed in more formal regimes. We value our informality, but don't ruin it for the rest of us by confusing that for mere anarchy.

If you fail at this, we reserve the right to make a rule, make it retroactive, and name it after you.
