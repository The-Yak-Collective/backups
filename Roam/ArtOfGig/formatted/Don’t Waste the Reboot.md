- This was our first [Pop-Up Think Tank](<Pop-Up Think Tank.md>) project
- If you do a reflection post, please link it in this page: [Reflections and Reviews ](<Reflections and Reviews .md>)
- This is the first of what we hope will be many [Yak Collective Collaborations](<Yak Collective Collaborations.md>). This one is being coordinated by [Paul Millerd](<Paul Millerd.md>). Target date for V 1.0 release: **April 30th**
- To discuss, join the Collaborations channel on the [Yak Discord server](<Yak Discord server.md>)
- **Purpose**: We are looking to put together a pitch deck of at least 20 Indie Ideas - short & punchy 1-2 slides per idea.  The frame of the deck is as a stark difference to the bland "new new new normal" McKinsey and other mainstream views.  Showing that we have something to offer idea-wise and in practical hire-us ways.
- Deck in progress: [Google slides link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OfBuSq4SImE1Gq2EaAGCAlkwC8LZRCWx-7O_VOHJ5TI/edit?usp=sharing)

- Add 2-slide sections according to these guidelines. Questions to [Paul Millerd](<Paul Millerd.md>)
    1. Add a 1-2 slide idea using the template in the deck (we can align formatting later)
    2. Also open to any comments on the go brrrrr  meme at the end  (WIP) 
    3. Provide any comments or create additional slides for consideration as needed to intro section
- Ideas (add your idea here if you're not yet ready to add to the deck)

- Opening and trailing slides list
    - 3 slides on Big3 stuff
    - 1 slide with 2x2 showing meta-view of lots of reports/decks
    - Maybe 1 slide with a view of [Covid19 Case Studies](<Covid19 Case Studies.md>) so far
    - 1 slide on the Yak Collective, with a 1 line tagline level [positioning](<positioning.md>), and simply a list of all the people who contributed to the deck. Can simply cut and past the boxes from the individual contribution slides
    - 1 slide with a COLLECTIVE call to action, as in "Email Paul to schedule a session with one or more Yak Collective members" (should design this offer... something any of us can deliver)

- Timeline of launch and promotion: 
    - VERSION 1 launched by **Thursday April 30** on the mailing lists of all contributors who have one. Using this [25 pieces launch email talking points](<25 pieces launch email talking points.md>) and a twitter thread summary tweeted out by @artofgig account summarizing the 20 ideas in 1 tweet each, and tagging the author of each tweet.
    - We do a ZOOM call led by Paul to work out a rough talk track so any of us can deliver at least a shallow-pass version of the WHOLE deck, based on how the author of each segment does it. Maybe we'll record a version where each person does their bit. 
    - We find 1-2 pilot clients, maybe pro-bono to deliver the deck live to, and get endorsements, which we add to Version 2 of the deck.
    - Launch Version 2 of the deck.
    - Aspirational: if this thing actually gains traction and a few orgs use it, we start adding "case study" slides to the end, showing how different orgs used this.
