- summary
    - Update new member on-boarding doc with Personal discord mgmt / muting strategies / relating to discord like Twitter
    - General sense that we should focus on the active community rather than new member on-boarding
    - Space for creating one-off generative events in b/n weekly voice chats and projects - Examples (what's in my tabs + dialect play through)
    - Tap people that seem to be engaged to run these events
    - Possibly separate out idea generation with event hosting
    - Experiments seem to be going well. A lot of experiments are not being captured in the experiment log.
    - Room for a formal feedback mechanism? Possibly not a [feedback](<feedback.md>) channel.
    - Anonymous form? Follow up for consideration - How to toe the line b/n anonymous feedback and openness? 
- new member on-boarding
    - [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)
        - don't have a spot for making something highly
        - something in b/n chats and projects? free form / relational projects + paid projects
            - [Vinay Débrou](<Vinay Débrou.md>)
                - can't keep up with every channel 
                    - figure out which conversations / channels
        - paid projects - expectation of level of competency 
        - maybe b/n   chats and paid projects - is some kind of generative events
            - involvement some kind of game/social generative thing

                - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)  set mute for everything 
            - don't see an on-boaridng ramp up issues 
    - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)
        - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)  set mute for everything 
    - [hershpat](<hershpat.md>)
        - as someone relatively new to YC, have on occassion found it difficult - to find it a place. 
        - possible way to bifurcate the space - dividing things up people up skills people providing and things that they're trying to learn from 
            - some of the room names aren't clear 
        - mostly by trial and error - not sure how else discord ... been using it on my phone... not sure about on laptop ... 
            - can be information overload ... trying to mute things so i can go in push 
                - trying to figure out tech 
                - [ ] add a note about muting channels 
        - get a lot of push notifications on chat 
        - Friday chats 
    - [Jordan Peacock](<Jordan Peacock.md>)
        - advocating for new people
            - dip into channels that i'm interested in - don't interested in catching up with channels
            - possibly lock some of the channels in opt-in ... like project channel.
        - treat it like Twitter
        - self-assignment mod 
- personal discord mgmt
    - muting aggressively
        - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)  set mute for everything 
        - [Vinay Débrou](<Vinay Débrou.md>)
            - can't keep up with every channel 
                - figure out which conversations / channels
        - async - optin read it like Twitter
- having an active community to engage with is motivated enough 
    - focus on the active community
    - another topic: the format of proposing new volunteer projects
        - standardize the project
        - project brief for neurofuturuma was valuable and missing for some of these acti
        - more clear roles defined
- Discord 
    - Opt-in channels 
    - Social events - social / generative theme - like gaming 
- [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)
    - Example 1
        - Sachin's idea - one-off call 
            - what's in my tabs
    - Example 2
        - play through of dialect - language - developing ideas
        - was also an engaging spectator event 
        - Yaks twitch out something 
            - that could be generative on its own 
    - calls need to have themes 
        - doesn't have real attraction to it broadly speaking
    - if there's already aligned interest 
    - here's some ideas ahlf-baked... or half-read article
        - serves a similar purpose to weekly calls
        - don't know what the reading is immediately before the call - broadly know the themes
    - usually kind of aligned with project 
        - really interested in seeing how that was going 
    - the calls right now make sense that go pragmatically
    - the what in my tabs call - generative potential - bc it's one off 
        - because there's no expectation of contributing. something might fall off... "liminal space" where something could happen 
- [Jordan Peacock](<Jordan Peacock.md>)
    - there's a demand for pt 2 of the Dialect run 
        - maybe just run it on Twitch 
- prompt: how can we encourage more people to host one-offs? generative stuff?
- [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>) there's a set of us that are frequent enough ... 
    - host one offs
    - pointing people that we see come to chats a lot 
    - Venkat's friday calls get a lot of people - a lot of other calls - surprised they're not bigger. Not sure if it's information problem or what we should expect.  Some of them are pretty high quality... 
    - [ ] chat host - ask about engaging people with one-off
- [hershpat](<hershpat.md>)  
    - idea generation channel ? 
        - maybe someone has an idea but doesn't want to host it... 
        - starting point 
- [Vinay Débrou](<Vinay Débrou.md>)
    - the most active people are going to more than one 
    - smaller channels/chats 
        - 3 people - 10 minute chats - i'm trying to do this ... 
        - whatever project they're working on 
    - couple sessions 
    - ..
        - Donut bot - virtual coffee
- experiments
    - experiment log 
    - encourage more experiment
    - are people willing to kill project
    - ask for direct feedback 
        - after experiment 
    - should there be a formal feedback mechanism 
        - [hershpat](<hershpat.md>)
            - maybe not a [feedback](<feedback.md>) channel 
            -  maybe a form? anonymous feedback
                - having a place to express the opinion
        - [Vinay Débrou](<Vinay Débrou.md>) focusing on projects/contributions/ownership
