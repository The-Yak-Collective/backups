- WORK WAYS in 2040 with Kernel’s neurotech achieving the adoption level same as that of PCs in 1990s---
- **Collaboration:**
    - A search engine that indexes thought-relations like a PageRank of thoughts, allows me to easily find someone who is thinking of the same (or an adjacent) concept as me. Great for finding collaboration partners for a new project. How much of the thought-data will be shared publicly? How much will be shared in private clusters?
        - Also might leak data, allow one to be manipulated? How do we manage privacy ? Anonymize neural data ? Matching and seeing conflicts ? Maybe test exercises + neural data will be helpful. What were they actually thinking while playing the simulation game [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>)
        - as a part of the wear this state to get into the club [Darren Kong: Dress Ways](<Darren Kong: Dress Ways.md>) how about using this for team building / ideation [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) get everyone in the same state. tie-in to [Scott Allen: Social Ways, Marriage Ways](<Scott Allen: Social Ways, Marriage Ways.md>)
- **Recruiting:**
    - Knowledge-work recruiting based on neuroimages of certain ‘learned skill’ modules -- job application form will have a field to upload your skill-neuroimage(SNI). That means more specific skills profile and better matching of jobs to be done with specific skills.
    - Currently we infer skills based on past experience but with SNI, a self-taught data-scientist can be compared more objectively and directly to someone with a Stanford Masters Degree and be decided who is a better match to the set of jobs-to-be-done. Old credentialing based on pedigree falls out of favor in high-skill jobs. Gig economy gets deeper penetration in high-skill jobs?
- **Meetings & Project Management: **
    - Telepathic memos and syncbrainstorming sessions. Synchronous collision of thoughts of meeting participants. Meeting data processed and interpreted in real time by neural data software that send spec-memos from executives to designers and engineers for production. What will this neural-data-processing project management software look like?
        - Opt-in emotion sharing, were the stakeholders __actually__ aligned? [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>). Maybe to take it a step further vote with your reaction!
- **Insider Knowledge:**
    - How will insider knowledge be kept inside? Currently companies provide a separate work computer that’s connected to the work network to keep proprietary IP safe. Will it be a separate workbrain with legal & technical restraints to sharing neural data or will it manifest as something completely different? Intranet-of-workbrains vs Internet-of-personalbrains?
        - Maybe Joseph Fridman can pitch in on this to give a reference on the fundamental limits of neuromonitoring hardware?
- **Productivity:**
    - Ultra high-productivity is chased by high-performing professionals/artists by using chemical drugs like LSD nano-dosing. In 2040, will there be a pursuit of productivity-boosting via software drugs that precisely neuro-simulate one on-demand? Neural software drug is to LSD nano-dose & caffeine what a sniper-gun is to a cannon?
        - Nano-dosing for sure. And all other biohacking? How does my insulin response curve interact with my mood? How does it interact with my productivity? [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) The flip side is that this will lead to [Scott Allen: Social Ways, Marriage Ways](<Scott Allen: Social Ways, Marriage Ways.md>). How do I get myself in the right mood for partying? 
        - This could also have overlap with [Vaughn Tan: Food Ways, Learning Ways](<Vaughn Tan: Food Ways, Learning Ways.md>)
- **Data Monetization:**
    - How will the monetization and distribution look like for neural data being used? How different will its fate be from the fate of digital data?
        - interaction w/ how the current personalization/3rd party data industry works. privacy model will be important [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>)
