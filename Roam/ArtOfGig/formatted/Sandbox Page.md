- Use this page to try to Roam editing. Look at the help box at the bottom right on the browser interface for keyboard short cuts. Most of it is standard markdown.
- Roam is very forgiving and it's easy to merge/change stuff, but be mindful of what other people are doing
- Testing "**Why:** At the end of the contest, the company could host a celebratory banquet to recognize the winners with awards such as “Most Innovative” implementation plan."
- Testing **What:** can actually be written in a block.
- Testing how to use the directory page 
    - High-usability version (allows people to read your page embedded within this page instead of jumping around):

        - Put a summary sentence/paragraph on your page. Create all additional content on your page indented under the first paragraph.
        - Copy the block ref of that summary paragraph
        - Embed (don't just copy)the block under your name on this page
            - Indented under your name on this page, start typing ```clojure
{{embed: (())}}``` and then paste your block ref. It should end up looking something like this: ```clojure
{{embed: ((((sOudXb4qS))))}}```This will embed that summary paragraph and anything else under it here on this page. You can then edit it in either place.
