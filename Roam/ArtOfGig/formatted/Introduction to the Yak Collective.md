- **What the Yak Collective is**
    - A place to try and make your gig economy life/indie consultant life more meaningful and fun
    - A network of free agents independent consultants/contractors/gig workers and people interested in experimenting with gig economy lifestyles either full time or part-time, including people going back and forth 
    - An infrastructure platform and evolving set of resources for indies who would otherwise lack such a space
        - An active Discord (~700 members, maybe 10% regularly active)
        - An evolving Roam knowledge base with
        - A sophisticated website with a member directory and powerful publishing capabilities
        - A social media presence (newsletter, twitter, linkedin, facebook) and set of marketing resources
    - A production support system (design, artwork, publishing) for an expanding set of project types mainly related to knowledge products
    - An experiment in decentralized organization and work strongly inspired by the open source world
- **What the Yak Collective is not**
    - **A self-conscious political experiment.** We are curious about various economic/political ideologies and talk about them, but we're primarily about interesting projects and getting things done
    - **A "how to" education space. **You might learn things as a side effect of other activities, but this isn't a "school for consultants" or a mentoring network
    - **A "networking" place to find gigs and leads.** You might find gigs as a side effect of other things (and people have), and there is some limited support, but it isn't a priority
    - **A "community" or "salon"** for generally talking about the gig economy or anything else. We talk a lot, but the focus is on doing, and the talking tends to be about the doing. There's plenty of other places you can go to if you want to talk.
    - **A blockchain project** we're curious about blockchain tech and open to experiments with it, and many of our members have deep knowledge in the area, but it's not the primary focus. We may at some point use blockchain tech if it fits something we want to do for other reasons, but we're not about blockchains for the sake of blockchains.
- **What the Yak Collective does**
    - Collaborative projects of mutual interest
        - learn new subjects
        - gain familiarity with new consulting topics and skills
        - develop trusted longer-term collaborations with other indies
        - build up portfolios
        - We've released 4 such projects already: [Don’t Waste the Reboot](<Don’t Waste the Reboot.md>), [The New Old Home](<The New Old Home.md>), [Astonishing Stories](<Astonishing Stories.md>), [Future Frontiers](<Future Frontiers.md>) and one is in the works [Yaks do innovation consulting](<Yaks do innovation consulting.md>)
    - Form collaboration teams and go after larger consulting gigs that individual indies otherwise would not be able to take on by themselves 
        - We've done one such project, [Neurofuturama](<Neurofuturama.md>)
    - Ongoing chat tracks on various subjects/themes of interest to members. Some have been going steady for a long time, such as [Yak Collective Governance](<Yak Collective Governance.md>) (Fridays 9 AM PT) and [infrastructure chats](<infrastructure chats.md>) (Sundays 10:30 AM PT) plus various transient ones that come and go
