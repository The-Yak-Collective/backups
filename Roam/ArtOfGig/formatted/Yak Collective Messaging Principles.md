- **INDIVIDUAL STYLE OVER GROUP STYLE**: but with some sensible minimalist defaults and ways to get help to improve your style if you need it
- **WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY**: Remember, how you talk about our shared work will reflect on the group as a whole, so do your fellow contributors proud :D
- **ASK FOR HELP**: If you're not confident about your style, or don't have one yet, talk to another member of the group with more experience and/or work with these defaults below
- **APPLY SENSIBLE DEFAULTS**: You won't win Nobel prizes with these defaults, but you won't do serious damage either. All these defaults can be violated of course, if you have the confidence and reason to.
    - CLARITY FIRST: Simple, clear language
    - AVOID CLICKBAIT PRINCIPLES: We want to reach the few serious people worth reaching, not wide/broad reach and a lot of pointless clicking
    - BREVITY RULES: The less you say, the less you can mess up
    - ENCOURAGE DEEP SHARING: For sharing, write in ways that get people to actually READ/REVIEW the deck themselves before forwarding.
    - AVOID SELF-AGGRANDIZING LANGUAGE: Avoid talking about our group with language like "diverse, weird collective" -- let the ideas speak for themselves and create the perception, not our aspirational tags
    - AVOID TRASH TALKING THE COMPETITION: it's fun to make fun of the Big 3 etc but let's lead with what we have, not what we think others lack. A little fun kayfabe/beefing is fine, but in general, we shouldn't have to tear others down to build ourselves up (principled critiques are different of course)
    - FRICTION IS GOOD: We do NOT want uncritical, low-friction sharing, so don't offer canned share tweets and such. One real tweet by somebody who actually read what we've written and liked what they saw is better than 10 uncritical "just helping cheaply boost a friend" type tweets
