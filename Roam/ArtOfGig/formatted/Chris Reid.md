- I'm going to keep my own little [warren](<warren.md>) on this Roam. (I'm not sure how to benefit from the linking here if I did this on my own personal Roam domain.) These notes aren't private, so feel free to peruse them: [Chris Reid's Yak Paths](<Chris Reid's Yak Paths.md>). I'll define warrens on its own page in case anyone stumbles into it and finds it useful.

- That makes sense! I could imagine that with widespread monitoring, we might begin to pathologize & preempt forms of mild atrophy that are considered normal, non-pathological effects of aging on the brain too. [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)

- "I really like the idea of anyone being able to mock up an image or direct a movie through visualization and some AI assist on details. It's like not just no-code but also no-body production" [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)

- "Assuming we can do that, I think that'd be a really interesting literalization of someone living on in the hearts and minds of others after death. That sounds like a big possible culture shift in attitudes towards death- the cessation of new episodes of YourLife, but with reruns continuing in syndication. I assume the deceased would insist on being the curator while alive. It could be a natural evolution of social media curation- we've all probably seen Facebook accounts turn to mausoleums over the years. [Chris Reid](<Chris Reid.md>)"
