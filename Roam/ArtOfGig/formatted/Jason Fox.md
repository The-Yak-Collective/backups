- The considerations that goes into an offsite before it happens can make or break it. Then the live event itself—how to flex improv, negative capability, trickster-spirit, divergence/convergence, coherence, cohesion etc etc. Then the aftermath—what happens next. #[Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>)

- Opportunity to re-enchant how we gather—that’s where I see us in the Yak Collective play very well. #[Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>)

- I suspect there may be perspectives we can contribute that will make any senior leader feel more inspired/confident to do it (whilst also positioning the Yak Collective as a potential facilitation partner/guide). #[Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>)

- If we have in mind a senior leader who wants to gather their distributed team (virtually) for an offsite-equivelant, the lens for this collaboration would be to collect and collate pragmatic-yet-refreshing perspectives on how this can be done. #[Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>)

- Also—having percolated on @Venkatesh Rao (US Pacific)’s suggestion a bit—it strikes me that there’s more than enough potential for us to do a low-key online offsite as a Yak Collective—which I would be happy to host. After that dry-run we could do a semi-staged one wherein we invite clients along. Using a tool like crowdcast would allow us to keep it recorded, so it can live as a reference point. #[Jason Fox](<Jason Fox.md>)
