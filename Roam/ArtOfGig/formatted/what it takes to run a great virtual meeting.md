- Use video. To make people feel like they’re all at the “same” meeting, use video conferencing rather than traditional conference dial-ins.
- Always provide an audio dial-in option. Video conferencing can work very well, but it relies on a strong internet connection that may not always be available.
- Test the technology ahead of time. Nothing kills momentum at the start of a meeting like a 15-minute delay because people need to download software, can’t get the video to work
- Make sure faces are visible. Video conferences are more effective when people can see each other’s facial expressions and body language.
- Stick to meeting basics. Prior to the conversation, set clear objectives, and send a pre-read if appropriate. During the session, use an agenda, set meeting ground rules, take breaks, and clearly outline next steps (including timing and accountabilities) after each section and at the end of the meeting.
- Minimize presentation length. The only thing worse than a long presentation in person is a long presentation during a virtual meeting. Meetings should be discussions. Background information should be provided beforehand.
- Use an icebreaker. Although we’re not big fans of them, it’s important to use every tool to reinforce interpersonal relationships when people may be feeling isolated.
- Assign a facilitator.
- Call on people. Getting everyone to participate without talking over each other is one of the more challenging aspects of running a virtual meeting.
- Capture real-time feedback. Gathering and processing high-quality input during a virtual meeting can be challenging, especially since visual cues are harder to read.
- Don’t be afraid to tackle tough issues.
