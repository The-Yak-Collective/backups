        - "The 'apprentice Yaks' are the ones who interest me."
        - "You need incentives and rewards the incentivize participation and trust.
        - "A circular currency is a measurement of the healthy of the community."
- [Jordan Peacock](<../../Jordan Peacock.md>)
    - Thinking about institutional lifecycles
        - Centered around addressing some problem, or enabling some group action
            - "It's exit-dominant."
            - "Formalization leads to ossification"
            - [Sachin Benny](<../../Sachin Benny.md>)
                - "Two things caught my attention."
                    - 2) With regards to the "New-Old Home Project", we can templatize project methodologies in Yak Collective. 
                        - __Note: Will follow-up. Not sure if I got this down correctly. - Alex__
                - 1) "Thinking about the conditions from voluntary activity to coercive expansion"
                    - "For example, Roam cult. There are people offering courses on how to set up and use Roam. Eventually, capital will become interested in Roam, a VC will invest.

- Not better TED talks, or better bureaucracies. How do you build something to work as quickly as possible? 
    - Being minimum viable new institutions.
- [Alex Wagner](<../../Alex Wagner.md>)
- How to create a Grand Unifying Problem to create "head-in-the-game" culture for Yaks.
    - Existential threats are great, but so is an effective, and urgent narrative.
- [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
    - Two challenges:
        - Conference-making 
        - Creating value out of production processes that are not necessarily tied to material objects, software etc.
    - Selling consulting, selling thinking.
        - "An open source consulting network that can compete with McKinsey." 
            - "It's a moonshot."
                - "Generating consulting revenue here is a level 5."
- The "Apprentice Yak"-level.
    - We can do a project that a traditional firm can't, we can apply a higher-level of sophistication to a Mechanical Turk-style process.
    - Skeptical of medieval guild-style hierarchy
        - Vision for guild is more along "Amazon affiliate network" model of hierarchy.
    - Encouraged: "Creating little profitable activities. Small teams, creating viral hits. Leads to workshops, client engagements.
        - Discouraged: free-writing pontification in Discord and Roam, attempts to leverage Yak for marketing purposes.

- [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
    - Doing experiments in "making that first consulting dollar"
        - Making first consulting dollar is an inflection point, a milestone. Kind of a big deal tbh.
        - In ways that are maximally-interesting. __(Paraphrasing here - Alex)__
- [John Grant](<../../John Grant.md>)
    - Speaking about "Topic-hacking"
        - Essentially creating "living documents" for people not 
        - "Using language that doesn't have any baggage"

        - [Jordan Peacock](<../../Jordan Peacock.md>)
            - With regards to working in open source
                - "YC is a hybrid between free-for-all project on github, and an incubator."
                    - "So far Yak feels like the best aspects of both."
- [Venkatesh Rao](<../../Venkatesh Rao.md>)
    - "An interesting public measure of success – stealing YC moniker from Y-Combinator"
