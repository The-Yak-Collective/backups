## [Wisdom from [general](<general.md>) [Internal Use]](<Wisdom from [general](<general.md>) [Internal Use].md>)
- building on what tom and vgr said, if your company doesn't already have an internal consulting group, it may be more frustrating and you'd learn less than just going solo and having the pressure to level-up on your own. It may be a decent option IF: - you can work directly for a c-level + you and him would have the credibility and cover to shift into a role (which could work especially if they are ex-consultant) - there is an existing group that has a good project management capability (most internal groups suck and do random reactive stuff in my experience) Alternatively, one option you might want to consider is to find a pro-bono, low fee or even regular fee if you can do it client on the side to put the pressure on yourself. You'll get to test out whether you can quickly level up your consulting skillset + also see if you like the responsibility of being in such a role [Paul Millerd](<Paul Millerd.md>)

- agree "wartime" doesn't feel right. I think a lot of the training for downturns comes from the behaviors indies gain in "peace" time because our mode of being is so different than that of the FTE. If anything, we need to shift to be the steady hand, default to giving without expectation, keep showing up etc... It seems that many indies who have been solo for a while deal with uncertainty all the time so they have experience to help clients think about this. If anything, just write...

- Hey there - does anyone have any examples of consulting companies shifting from fee-based work to a subscription model. Helping a client pressure test this idea. - [Paul Millerd](<Paul Millerd.md>)

- similar to what VGR mentions. At the core its kind of like a leap of faith. The more people that know youre working solo, the more people will funnel you people to talk with. For the first couple of years, I focused on writing about the meta-journey of going solo, sharing useful information via writing & proactively reaching out to orgs I wanted to work with (even pro bono sometimes). Similar to VGR again sometimes things take 12-18 months to even show up as a gig. I had someone I had 3-4 convos with in 2017 recently reach out with some actual real work. You need to find some mode that you like reaching out to people - whether its social media, writing, calling people, emailing them, etc. To be honest if you're still actively looking for jobs thats going to show up in how people think about working with you and how you commit to the journey. Gigging is going to be more about luck than not if you're not committing to at least an initial experiment of 12-18 months - [Paul Millerd](<Paul Millerd.md>)
