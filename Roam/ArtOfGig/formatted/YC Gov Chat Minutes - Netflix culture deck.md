    - Netflix Culture is uniquely suited for Netflix. Copying it would be unwise.
    - It is counterintuitive.
    - Some elements of it however can be useful in the context of Yak Collective.
    - One such element is Freedom and Responsibility. It is relatively well discussed on Netflix culture page or elsewhere.
    - Another useful element is Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled. It probably needs to be unpacked, but it seems to me that it requires a lot of clarity in both the overall mission and the roles different people can play.
    - They insist that they are a professional sports team, not recreational sports team. YC cells or squads or teams may benefit from this type of a mindset. (e.g. train, know the game your playing, be ready to compete and win).
    - Added after the call: One way to address alignment is actually to create a few projects with an intention to ship customer facing (paid) products or services. This may require a little bit more clarity about governance model. But it is worth doing anyway.
    - A real culture is more discovered than prescribed. Netflix culture doc shows both some critical tensions and the directions in which the org wants them to be resolved. 
    - Both are to be discovered in case of YC.

    - we're go-to-war-with-the-yaks-you-have. I am usually wondering if I have sufficient chops to contribute.
        - > Discussing the military’s performance during the Iraq War, Donald Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, once famously said, “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.” When I talk to managers about creating great teams, I tell them to approach the process in exactly the opposite way.

    - What can YC learn from Netflix's aggressive/clever marketing?
Things like:
        - Long term partnerships – the Neflix button on TV remote controls
        - Attracting talent - Open sourcing Chaos Monkey
    - Publishing (sponsored) living documents on GitHub?
    - Leveraging the YC network to conduct polls / surveys?

- [Sachin Benny](<Sachin Benny.md>)
    - Netflix values that stood out to me
        - Highly aligned, loosely coupled - being highly aligned in an extreme decentralized situation such as Yak requires smaller teams working on focussed ambitious projects 
        - Context not control/healthy disagreement - healthy levels of dissent and disagreement is a good sign that projects can progress without a BDFL
    - Needs some extreme chaos monkey like mechanism where someone takes over when one of the project members/leaders go MIA
    - For the professional sports metaphor to apply - the competition or the game needs to be defined better 
- [Scott Garlinger](<Scott Garlinger.md>)
    - ...
- [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
    - I’m somewhere between skeptical and not skeptical of their account if themselves
    - There’s an extremism gap between their idea of decentralized governance and YC level
    - Core strongly aligned/loosely coupled idea ports, but more extremely applied
    - For sports team metaphor to apply similar to guild leader’s handbook ideas, the “game” here needs to be better defined
    - Maybe as Sachin said key to going more ambitious is smaller teams to allow better alignment. At least initially. Our current teams may be too big.
