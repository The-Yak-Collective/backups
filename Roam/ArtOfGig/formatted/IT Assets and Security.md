- # Threats
    - ## Current
        - Data loss (Roam, Google, GitHub)
            - Wanton destruction or ransom attempts (includes some social media take-overs)
            - Members leaving who have access to data/billing
            - Service disruptions
        - Infrastructure misuse (malware or phishing being hosted on website, spam through our email or mailing list)
        - Griefers
            - Website defacement
            - Social media account take overs
        - Branding and IP?
            - Someone else claiming to be the Yak Collective (species of griefer)
            - Copyright, other IP claims
    - ## (Possible) Future
        - Data breach (We don't collect enough, or the right type, of information right now through our sign-up form for this to be a problem, but we might at some point.)
            - Google Form
            - Discord?
        - Disclosure (This probably only really matters if we have projects where premature disclosure would be harmful to the client.)
            - Works in progress
            - Discord chats
        - Financial (We don't have a bank account now, but as soon as we do there are all sorts of new internal and external risks.)
    - ## Non-Threats
        - Physical threats
            - We don't work together in the same space, many of us have never even met in person.
            - Personal risks are similar to any other online activity.
            - What might change this?
                - The more information we gather about our members, the more dangerous we become to them (stalkers, etc.).
                - If the Yak Collective ever worked on a particularly controversial project, this would raise __all__ of our risks -- including physical risks to our members.

- # Possible Mitigations
    - Trust between members (especially members with access to various assets)
    - Separation of duties for Class 1 and 2 assets
        - No one person should have access to __all__ assets in a category
        - Conversely, none of these asset should be controlled by only a single person
        - `yakcollective.org@gmail.com` acts as a failsafe for a set of our accounts. Only __very__ trusted people should have access to this account!
    - Principal of least access for access to assets
        - We shouldn't go nuts about this, but we also shouldn't just give people access to something if unneeded
        - Access should be periodically audited
            - Most of our assets use shared logins right now üòì
                - If the app has a list of when someone accessed it, then this should be periodically checked to make sure that times and IPs look okay
                - Use a password manager for tracking too (but don't __only__ use this!)
            - In cases where access isn't shared, periodically check access logs and audit users.
    - Strong passwords, 2FA (can also become a central point of failure)
        - We should definitely be using password managers to make sure that our passwords are strong and not duplicative
        - Using a password manager will also make it easier to routinely rotate passwords and audit who has access to what
        - Separation of duties suggests that we should ideally not have a single password vault, or a system where a single role/entity could access all password information.
            - This is __very__ difficult to realize in practice, however.
            - [Password Manager Comparison](<Password Manager Comparison.md>)
    - Backups (can also be a risk)
        - People in charge of a given asset should also be in charge of backing that asset up (preferably locally, to an encrypted computer and/or external drives)
- # Recommendations
    - Infrastructure roles:
        - Right now, there are too few assets, and too few people, and YC is too young to worry about well-defined roles. Also, such roles discourage potential cross-pollination between different infrastructure classes.
        - All assets should have no more than 4 and no less than 2 admin users.
            - Given the small size of the Yak Collective, we probably want to aim for 2 in most cases.
        - No one person should have access to more than 50% of the assets in a given category.
        - Class 1 assets should be restricted to only highly trusted users (probably don't want a nobody like me getting access to `yakcollective.org@gmail.com` again).
        - All assets and admin users should be centrally tracked (I think this could just be a spreadsheet in Google).
        - All admins are responsible for periodically auditing access for assets they control (that record login information) __at least__ once per month.
        - All admins are responsible for periodically backing up and auditing access for assets they control __at least__ once per month.
        - If we have two admins per asset, each admin does a backup/audit of their assets every two months with a one-month offset, then we easily meet this goal with probably only an hour or so of time commitment (on average) per admin.
    - We should copy critical documents into the `yakcollective.org@gmail.com` Google Drive.
        - This doesn't mean that project contributors have to work out of that Drive. When a project is ready, we should just copy assets into the Drive and use those assets for actual sharing on the website, etc.
        - Asset/Admin tracking should also live here.
    - We should move to using strong, randomized passwords from a password manager + 2FA for all accounts that support it.
        - Fine for the moment, I think, to store 2FA in the password manager. This __does__ make the password manager a single point of failure for those logins, but it is still better than having no 2FA. If we start dealing with bank accounts, etc., then we may want to rethink this.
        - Passwords should be rotated whenever someone steps away from their role, or if they think they may have been compromised (ransomware, etc.), or at a minimum annually.
            - No requirement for a unified password infrastructure yet.
        - Obviously, services where we're using our personal accounts (GitHub, Facebook, anything else?) should just keep using those accounts.
            - But I'd __strongly__ encourage any admin people to up their security game.
            - We should still track access...
- # Questions
    - None of the password managers I've looked at really meet our requirements.
        - After much thought, I __don‚Äôt__ think we should standardize on a password manager, unless there‚Äôs appetite to do so. Instead, we should continue to use our own systems, but rotate passwords regularly/on ‚Äústaff‚Äù change.
        - [Password Manager Comparison](<Password Manager Comparison.md>)
        - Bitwarden or LastPass probably come closest if we use a one-password-per-collection paradigm. But the admins of these systems can then gain access to everything, violating our desire for more dispersed responsibilities.
        - If we divide into more discrete teams, then any of the proposed solutions would work. KeeWeb + Google Drive is great if we're cheap (or Gopass if we're cheap and technical). 1Password is best-in-breed.
            - There __is__ a rough division of duties that the current assets suggest...
                - **Internal infrastructure**
                    - "Roam"
                    - "Discord"
                    - "Password managers or databases"
                        - Only if we don't go with something like KeePass/KeeWeb or Gopass, in which case we'd just include this with the appropriate bit of external infrastructure.
                    - "Bank accounts, should we ever have such a thing"
                - **External infrastructure**
                    - "`yakcollective.org@gmail.com` (Gmail)"
                        - Per recommendations, I think this should also host all of our docs/files (at least in an archival sense).
                    - "DNS (Namecheap?)"
                    - "GitHub"
                    - "Netlify"
                    - "IFTTT"
                    - "Glitch (currently unused)"
                - **Outreach**
                    - "Substack"
                    - "Twitter"
                    - "Facebook"
                    - "LinkedIn"
            - This feels like  a more formal set of lines of responsibility that we seem to want.
            - That said, going this route and then paying for a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password creates a nice set of checks between the internal and external infrastructure people.
            - ...It's kinda hard in this scenario for [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) to step back from the role of benevolent dictator, given that they probably need access to items from all three groups...
    - We should have some kind of heads-up + veto system for new admins.
        - Not sure what this should be... Everything I think about feels like bureaucratic larping.
    - We may want to consider setting some kind of retention period for Discord.
        - We may need a custom bot for this.
    - Having only one person in charge of paying for a service is risky. Can we mitigate this without adopting a more formal structure?
