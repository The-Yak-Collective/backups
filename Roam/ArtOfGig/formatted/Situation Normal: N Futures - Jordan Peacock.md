- This is a game that I've been developing through my company, Sortilege. But it's also a futurism thinking tool and I'll present the bones of this in a week or so and let people take and mash it up, weaponize it.
- To get a sense of it's predecessor, see my Magic: the Gathering reskin, Be Slightly Evil, from 2015. Situation Normal was birthed from this.
