- module led by [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>) and part of the [Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>)-lead [The New Old Home](<The New Old Home.md>) project
- new [occupational hazards](<occupational hazards.md>) in [parenting](<parenting.md>)

- notes on the literal design, the idea of a new home office, new needs that a home will require and what affordances a home should now be able to provide (home gym, home office, de-compressive spaces for parents, video chat tools, greater demand on single family units)
    - [Zoom](<Zoom.md>) and [video chat](<video chat.md>) tools:
        - corner of a room, backdrop, plants
        - ring light
        - [Power Posing for Zoom - Experiments in camera based status transactions ](<Power Posing for Zoom - Experiments in camera based status transactions .md>) link?  
    - greater reliance on identity through performance art/avatar in style of [Tik Tok](<Tik Tok.md>)
        - [Zoom](<Zoom.md>) as [Tik Tok](<Tik Tok.md>) for adults? 
- one idea for approach is to go through home, office, etc., sections of [A Pattern Language](<A Pattern Language.md>) by [Christopher Alexander](<Christopher Alexander.md>) and mark patterns as:
    - still relevant 
    - no longer relevant
    - need to be adapted 
- https://www.autonomous.ai/zen-work-pod
    - extension to ones home 
    - new thing in sales
    - [Tiago Forte](<Tiago Forte.md>) tweeted about this recently (must find tweet), asking if this is something that people would likely be interested in  
- separation of space vs multi use spaces
    - [Sarah Sushanka](<Sarah Sushanka.md>) question in [Not so Big House](<Not so Big House.md>) book 
        - she advocates for multi use spaces rather than modular room-for-every-use-case build of homes  
    - impacted by predictions in real-estate market 
- boundaries and transition spaces 
- home gym sales, etc.
    - find that collaboration paper on Covid19 secondary effects and silo-out all trend predictions relevant to "domestic" space and itemize 
- balance between opinionated vs cartographer tone in this piece 
    - advocating for a certain aesthetic a la Alexander? or just demarcating upcoming relevant possibilities?
