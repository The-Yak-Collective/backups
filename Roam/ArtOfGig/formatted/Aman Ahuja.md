- Hi, my name is Aman. 
    - I work with [Civil Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society) partnerships (read: non-profit, funder, and either a government or private sector stakeholder) around data products. 
    - Thus the domains in which I'm interested include data governance and ethics, [collaboratives](https://datacollaboratives.org/), facilitating inequitable power dynamics in stakeholder collaboration, product strategy, and in ways in which academic teams launch sustainable data-driven teams and tools. 
    - And climate change.
- Yak: I'm interested in finding individual Yak'ers or assembling small Yak-teams for collaboration.
    - Currently: I'm not very active in the Yak community yet, so I won't post any current needs or interests as they may become obsolete by the time someone reads them. Please reach out to me instead.
- Although always out of date, you can case studies of my work under the "Projects" section of my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanahuja)
- Best way to reach me: Discord for casual chat. Email for the rest, I suppose. 
- To do: 
    - [x] Add a basic description of my work to this directory
    - [ ] Attend a Yak intro session to orient
    - [ ] Connect with a few Yak people based on their directory profiles, ideally a few people in a similar domain but more familiar with the Yak community.
