        - V2.2 website, backend clean up, documentation/code comments
            - Wanting to beef up the Roam page to help with onboarding other people 
        - Featured yak has some issues still
        - Nathan met with Sachin, Jenna, Chris re Astonishing Stories
            - Have dev test on structure of having projects that can have n arbitrary pages
        - Long-term move to Gatsby
            - allow for more robust data integrations
            - there's experiments with combining Roam + Gatsby as presentation layer
    - Roam back up - currently manual monthly... automatic? 
    - Making updates to [Yak Collective State of the Union](<Yak Collective State of the Union.md>)
- infrastructure chat 16 8.29.2020 
    - https://tilnow.github.io/docjs/index
        - Tried to look into how this could work in Roam using the mermaid diagram... can't link out to pages atm
    - Nathan - documentation sprint on Roam  [Yak Collective Website](<Yak Collective Website.md>) page
    - discord changes were being implemented by Jordan + people he invited (ping Jordan for update)
    - Knack integration 
        - demo of website that pulls in data from Knack (which is itself a copy of github data) - almost works perfectly. there's a problem with Jekyll plugin -> member pages are getting wrong layout
    - gov question after the implementation is figured out... 
        - how do we want to handle - Jenna has been leading some of that [Privacy Policy](<Privacy Policy.md>)
            - how do we want to publicize
            - what level of controls
            - GDPR compliance given worldwide membership
    - [Schema | member data](<Schema | member data.md>)
        - only required fields in YAML atm are Name and Avatar
            - tabled the idea of pulling that from discord (GDPR compliance)
                - people on website are the contributors to projects
            - do we want to have discord name? 
        - possibility of Roam-Web integration in a future version of the site in Gatsby
            - example: https://mathieudutour.github.io/gatsby-digital-garden/
            - concern on data consistency but will be addressed with Roam's new backend
    - move the chat to Sunday which is better for Nathan and Maier
    - revisit [IT Assets and Security](<IT Assets and Security.md>)
        - do another pass at the credential documentation in this page
        - currently share netlify account that is owned by our "robot" github account - we would need 3 members if we were to go paid $19 per member x3 members / mo
