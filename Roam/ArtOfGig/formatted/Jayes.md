- In the same vein of jungian typology, Venkat's Gervais principle also maps office workers into archetypes. Perhaps this might be something interesting considering the work-oriented nature of the Yak Collective? Given the VUCA of Covid-19, I'll hazard that a skill sociopaths (or whatever archetype thrives in VUCA) will develop is the ability to believe anything they want to believe. This is distantly related to "bluepilling" from the matrix/4chan sphere as well as something Robert Caro wrote about LBJ in his biography of him. Instead of Mckinseyian "Find the truth through complicated math+statistics", find the optimal action and then justify whatever leads to it as the truth. - [Jayes](<Jayes.md>)
