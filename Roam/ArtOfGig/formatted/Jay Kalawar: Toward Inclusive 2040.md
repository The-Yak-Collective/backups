- As I write this, many questions are being raised in June of 2020, in the US, (if you are reading this many years from now, please search for what happened in the US in the May - June 2020 frame). Most of the question seem to focus on the immediate short term. 
- What I am proposing here is that we visualize the society you want to live in twenty years from now, in 2040. Most of us would like it to be a much more abundant and much more inclusive society
- Hence Toward Inclusive 2040, in short TI2040.
- 6 steps are proposed. Each step may be executed as its own 2-4 week sprint to be green-lighted into the next step? Here is the very preliminary proposal outline: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eXGEn5LVrfO5lro8h2RUvoXOj-a38OJNueMU96FGJBI/edit?usp=sharing
