- Welcome to the [Yak Collective](<Yak Collective.md>) community Roam database. 
- This resource aims to be of on-going use to the gig economy community. 
- The content and construction mirrors the basic methods of [Yak Collective](<Yak Collective.md>), similar to open source software: decentralized, communal, voluntary participation, booting up greater expertise through iterative refinements 
- There's several ways to plug into the collective
    - Discord is a bazaar that hosts a wide range of topics. It's chatty, and you'll learn who is most active, which correlates with their engagement & expertise
    - To familiarize yourself with Roam, start at [Sandbox Page](<Sandbox Page.md>) to learn basics. There's also a [Help Database](https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1308)
    - Once you're comfortable with adding and editing in Roam, you'll be able to create pages at will, and under the right top-level pages where it makes sense, or make a new top-level page if it makes sense. Cross-link liberally. Don't worry about page titles. They can be easily updated and globally changed, and merged with other pages when there is redundancy.
    - Joining a Project is the main path to contributing and profiting from participation 
        - [ ] Add project names
            - [ ] Add project calendars beneath each
        - Participation in a project is the point, so joining  [Yak Collective](<Yak Collective.md>) won't likely deliver value until you find one that aligns with your skills and interests
            - Content expertise is not the only way to contribute
            - If you consult in it, pitch it as a value add
                - Project management in the decentralized communities is not automatically coherent, so consider that role as a way to learn more
                - Graphic design is under-represented
                - Developers, developers, developers 
                - Data scientism
        - Project proposals snowball from the interest and volunteer energy that is sparked. It is possible at any point to try to start building sufficient interest to initiate 
- Initially, useful things here are primarily related to the [Coronavirus and the Gig Economy](<Coronavirus and the Gig Economy.md>) test
- The community is codifying [Rules and Code of Conduct](<Rules and Code of Conduct.md>), so be sure to respect these. If you can imagine making improvements, that's inherently possible. 
- [ ] Find the [Index](<Index.md>) page where you can begin exploring, editing etc.
