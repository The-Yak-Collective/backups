- **About**: This is an informal ledger of available funds that uses the native Roam calculator to keep a running tally of available funds. Looking for a volunteer to beef up this page, either in-line here and/or via connecting to an actual spreadsheet.
- **Rules**:
    - Anyone can request funds for an [Internal Project](<Internal Project.md>) once it has been started.
    - You have to formally pitch and start a project via the [Project Pitches](<Project Pitches.md>) in order to be eligible for funding. 
    - Funds may also be used for whole or partial reimbursement of YC expenses (such as domain names, hosting or other shared services) etc. 
    - A [Client Project](<Client Project.md>) is required to contribute at least 10% of its revenues to these funds. 
    - Currently discord admins make a consensus decision on grants.
    - Funds are held by whoever brought them (eg: project lead for a paid project) in or committed them (donor). At present YC has no financial infrastructure of its own. When a grant is made, someone holding adequate funds on YC's behalf is instructed to make the appropriate payment.
