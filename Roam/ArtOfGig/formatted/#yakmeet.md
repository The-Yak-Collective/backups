- Help the world meet a yak collaborator. Here's a suggested format:
    - Find a contributor you want to learn from and invite them to a 15m recording session via Zoom
    - Ask them 3-4 questions about their contribution
    - Edit the conversation down in [Descript](https://descript.com) (make it as bare-bones or fancy as you like) and publish it on YouTube
    - Share on social with [yakmeet](<yakmeet.md>)
- Examples from [Don’t Waste the Reboot](<Don’t Waste the Reboot.md>)
