- The Pop-Up Think Tank is the first offering model developed by the Yak Collective. 
- So far there are 2 instances, [Don’t Waste the Reboot](<Don’t Waste the Reboot.md>) 
- (our first [Internal Project](<Internal Project.md>) and [Neurofuturama](<Neurofuturama.md>) (our first [YC Client Project](<YC Client Project.md>))
- Runs for between 2-6 weeks
- Delivers a deck of ideas, insights, provocations, frameworks, and models around a chosen topic area
- Built around an efficient [Coordination Model](<Coordination Model.md>) that has already been validated on one or more internal projects, and set up to accept contributions from between 6-30 people.
- Potential phases of the model
    - Discovery/brainstorm/learning week (for projects requiring some technical prework to contribute to)
    - Week long sprints each resulting in an improved version
    - Refinement week
