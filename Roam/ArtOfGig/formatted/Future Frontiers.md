-  The goal of the future frontiers project to create an evolving, curated set of small modules spotlighting an idea, concept, trend, or piece of design fiction relating to frontiers and exploration. 
- Anyone can submit a contribution by adding a few slides to the [Future Frontiers Input Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oIziqtVM878uRG-JOfrQNvGFsQWKP_S_W8cLkhQlXvA/edit?usp=sharing) (open for read-only browsing/commenting, but you'll need to request permission to add a submission) in the prescribed format below.
- If approved by the editor (currently [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)) it will go into a lightweight production process (currently coordinated by [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>)) and end up as a page on the [Yak Collective Website](<Yak Collective Website.md>) and featured in the newsletter
- **Launch Date: **Current goal is to launch with the first 3 modules by **Dec 1, 2020**
- **Format**
    - We are using an [Infinity Pool](<Infinity Pool.md>) format suitable for ongoing contribution 
    - The **default input format** as of November 1, 2020 is this [Google Slides deck]() comprising a series of relatively stand-alone modules of 2-3 slides. In future, this may be turned into a Google Form with the appropriate fields.
    - The **default output format** is a page on the [Yak Collective Website](<Yak Collective Website.md>), indexed on the main page for the future frontiers project. Each submodule (as described below) will become a vertical segment on the page of your contribution.
    - Each input module (set of slides on the same idea)should comprise 1 or more SEQUENCED submodules (1 slide), each with the following 3 elements:
        - **Submodule title**: of 6-8 words at most
        - **1 anchor graphic**: this can be an evocative image, table, block diagram, mind-map, etc. Please make sure you're using either original or open-source licensed material.
        - **100-250 words of text** (optional but strongly recommended): this should succinctly describe the idea. This can be a prose paragraph, a bullet list, a list of references, etc.
    - If you have a large graphic and/or a lot of text in a single submodule you can spread it over 2 slides.
    - If you need to break the default format, talk to the editor [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) and/or production lead [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) to see if it can be accommodated
- **Framework**
    - We use the [PESTLE  (Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal Ecological) framework](<PESTLE  (Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal Ecological) framework.md>) framework as an initial brainstorming tool to think through the implications of a module, but not explicitly unless it is useful.

            - 
    - **Motivation**:
        - Space exploration has helped humanity tremendously to improve various facets of our lives on earth. Government agencies and few wealthy individuals funded and executed various space exploration activities. It is widely believed that humans will move ahead from space exploration to exploitation.
        - In the next few decades many small companies, groups of individuals will also participate heavily in both space exploration and exploitation. This will lead to colonization of space and give humans possibility to expand their societies beyond what is possible today.
        - With this premise, the objective of this collaboration project is to create multidisciplinary future visions of democratized space and oceans exploration and exploitation.
    - **Framework**: Plan is to follow the [PESTLE  (Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal Ecological) framework](<PESTLE  (Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal Ecological) framework.md>) to study the impact of democratized Space Exploration & Exploitation. Each theme can possibly have multiple sub themes.
    - **Tentative Output format**: **A slide deck** to help technology companies, investors, individuals to visualize the possibilities and conflicts, generate business ideas, to understand their role in the future.

        - [James Crook](<James Crook.md>)
            - Readings:
                - [Value of Asteroids](https://www.asterank.com/) also [Asteroid Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining): This is one model for economic exploitation of space - and looks fundamentally flawed to my eyes.
                - [The Scientists of Star wars](https://granta.com/the-scientists-of-star-wars/) __paywalled__: Read this for a deep account of how Space Exploration has been used to motivate technologists to work on technology for war and destruction.
                - [Space Spin-Offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies): My bias is that technology from space research will have more impact than space exploration itself over the next 30 years.  Looking closer at past reality and myths about spin-offs is worth doing.
                - [Factors in the falling cost of going into space](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/74082/ICES_2018_81.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
            - If we explore the effect of space exploration/exploitation on 'Mothership Earth', e.g. what technology/medicine/manufacturing advances more rapidly, this would make the deck relevant to a wider clientele than a deck intended just for the 'space pioneers' (SpaceX et al.).  Space Exploration/Exploitation has impact back on Earth in all PESTE categories 
                - **I had Political Economic and Technology paragraphs in here, and ROAM has deleted them.**
                - SOCIOCULTURAL: A Uniting Goal - What emotional/psychological effect does a shared big-goal (like colonising Mars) have on society and international relations?  Does it unite and motivate, or is it 'bread and circuses'
                - ECOLOGICAL: My own bias is that the effect will be indirect.  For example work to design/create self sustaining environments for Mars will accelerate work on desert reclamation.  
            - I would support LEGAL being added too, if others want it, for a PESTLE framework.  It needn't be as dry and dusty as legal books.  The ownership questions are ultimately social, about conflict or collaboration.
                - ~~Proposed title, in fact,~~ Possible title then for a module within the deck:  'Who owns the Moon?' with that being a proxy for ownership rights on space, on asteroids, right to de-orbit over my country, but also rights over the electromagnetic spectrum, and space tech intellectual property ownership rights.
            - Aside: an additional possible organising structure, perhaps within a module, is a division into near-space (orbit) medium-space (moon) far-space (mars/asteroid belts).  This is also, a temporal division short term (which is more relevant to more clients) to long term (which is more speculative, and maybe we should focus on less, if we want to create a useful deck).
        - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)
            -  Is it possible to take a shot at calculating something like Return-on-Investments or Economic Value for all the previous Space Programs to see how and by whom it was captured and what can be different now compared with earlier periods?
            - There are also some interesting second order effects of space technologies.  E. g. we can now have billions of tiny gyroscopes in our pockets without much thinking about it. 
Next decade can bring more examples like this one.
        - [Johann Richard](<Johann Richard.md>)
            - Although not as high-profile as some of the US-based initiatives, a lot is happening elsewhere too (e.g. Europe, but of course also India, China, Australia, NZ or Middle-East, as well as Africa) 
                - Might be worth considering expanding the focus a bit 
                - Due to my role I probably won't be able to contribute too much but if you need intros (especiall in Europe) let me know
                - In terms of technologies enabling this in the long term (we speak multiple decades for real exploitation), also look at initiatives like https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/The_ESA_Lab_Initiative  
        - [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>) 
            - I am very interested in collaborating 
                - I was actually just thinking about how in relation to [Farcaster Mansion](<Farcaster Mansion.md>) by [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>), homes/living/mansions/travel are going to take on the feel of traversing space, with homes as micro self-sustaining spaceships in network connection to one another
                - reminds me of "star ownership" 
                - new title for the project would be best: punchier, shorter.

            - you might want to have a look at http://www.oecd.org/futures/ as well, Space x Oceans is quite a topic of interest for some and as [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) notes, there are potential synergies which are being looked at, e.g. also by initiatives here in Europe:
        - [Thomas Verhagen](<Thomas Verhagen.md>)
            - Very much like the addition of oceans here. Host of sustainability/ earth systems/ economics angles with mid term uncertainties. These have all kinds of possible feedbackloops into business & policy decisions, and therefore into potential clients.
        - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
            - I’d definitely support something very much down the realist path rather than science fiction. Tons of space science  fiction out there already of all types and that’s not really the point of YC projects anyway. OTOH as you said no point replicating space agency roadmaps poorly. I think the nice gap to explore is space access for the middle class: those with some resources but not enough even for early trips to LEO let alone Mars with Elon. So... I think that means mainly time-shared robotic access. Look at various cubesats/nanosats, small rover programs like google’s, time-shared space telescopes (hubble4all?), etc.
            - Since my own background is in aerospace, I’d probably be conservative-realist as a participant on such a project... while I’m very fond of wildly implausible space science fiction myself, in the medium term of ~20-40 years at least, space exploration is **very** well scoped and constrained. There are zero game changers on the horizon in fundamental terms. Much as I hate to say it, there will be no warp drives, artificial gravity, force fields, or low-energy launch capabilities in our lifetimes. The closest to a wild breakthrough that’s even conceivable is space elevators, which I’d assign a 0.1% probability.(edited)
            - But a lot is possible within what is already possible: chemical rockets, cheap probes and rovers, etc.
            - Also, a possible rescope suggestion: make it space AND oceans and call it “democratizing frontiers”. Oceans are as much of a mystery as space right now, maybe more so, and more democratically accessible. See the OpenROV project. Also connects earth to space organically and ties in to science in service of terraforming, climate change, etc. You could also add other extreme environments like Sahara, atacama deserts, arctic tundra, and look at democratizing access to those frontiers? Unless you’re a traditional nomad tribe member or gulag prisoner it’s actually still quite hard to just live in those places
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSSI-1
        - [Charlie Bilsland](<Charlie Bilsland.md>)
            - my steer would be that 'Who Owns the Moon' is a very, very loaded question in the space sector, and there are multiple different answers.  The OST goes into detail that appropriation is not allowed, but both Artemis Accords and Hague Working Group on ISRU sets out provisions for use of the moon.  Lots of discussion around 'safety zones' and 'economic zones' on the moon, similar to Law of the High Seas.  I'm happy to collaborate on this - still getting used to Roam, but plenty to contribute to this discussion!
        - [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)
            - Feasibility/scope: Is it possible to probe the depths of both oceans and space in one project? I understand that oceans are more accessible, so more relevant to the public at large.
