# Channel Categories
    ## Plaza
        General discussion and information channels.
            - "[Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Just as this revision makes a distinction between "internal" and "external" projects, it resurrects the "Discussions" sections as an internal counterpart to "Plaza". Conceptually: "Plaza" is like a Roman Forum -- announcements happen there, public calendars are maintained, someone's writing "help wanted" ads in chalk, etc. "Discussions" are conversations (that may or may not be "public") that would instead be held indoors -- coffee shop philosophy, topical conversation that people may or may not care about, non-project planning, etc."
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Public Plaza" ‚Üí "Plaza".
            - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[experiments-log](<experiments-log.md>)` from "Plaza" to "Discussions"
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[take-gig-leave-gig](<take-gig-leave-gig.md>)` from "Discussions" to "Plaza"
            - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ "Move channels from "Bureaucracy" to "Discussions" as appropriate (basically, all channels not listed as being moved elsewhere)"
                - "[Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Basically:"
                    - ""^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[infrastructure](<infrastructure.md>)`, `[production](<production.md>)`, `[bots-and-automation-](<bots-and-automation-.md>)ü§ñ`, and `[yc-marketing](<yc-marketing.md>)` from "Bureaucracy" to "Projects"""
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[yaktalk-content](<yaktalk-content.md>)` from "Bureaucracy" to "Plaza"
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Set **Server Settings > Overview > System Messages Channel** to `[announcements](<announcements.md>)`, turn __off__ **Send a random welcome message when someone joins this server** and **Send a message when someone boosts this server**, and archive `[general](<general.md>)`.
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) `[events](<events.md>)` has a distinct purpose and there is a desire to keep `[announcements](<announcements.md>)` low-noise. Join events (which is really all that exists in `[general](<general.md>)`) are just noise, and the channel isn't used for anything else.
                - __Previous proposed version of this change is archived below this bullet.__
                    - Merge `announcements`, `events`, and `general`.
                        -  [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) events should be separate and include only reminders for events. i think.
                        - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) I'd be curious to hear from the originators of `general` and `announcements` what the original concept was; am otherwise good with one channel. While I appreciate the thought from Maier about keeping `events` separate, the current three channels together are low-volume enough that KISS‚Ñ¢ wins the day for me
                        - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) just lazy defaults. iirc general was auto-created as the default channel when I set up the discord. Either that or I copied slack default. can‚Äôt remember. In general we weren‚Äôt being particularly thoughtful in the first few weeks.
                        - [Hugo Macedo](<Hugo Macedo.md>) can we remove the auto checkin msgs from general? 
                            - today I think they are just noise and fill the feed without value.either they become background
                            - either we use general for other things and this becomes just background noise
                            - or we toggle-off if that's a feature
                            - or we turn general into an signalling channel only with auto messages - ideally changing the name.
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F--Ccni31k3.png?alt=media&token=9cc59055-27c6-477b-97b5-e2dfbcc394af)
                        - [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) I vote for merging general and events and keeping announcements separate since there's a lot more on-going noise for general/events, and announcements should be the place to check for official messages.  
                            - alternatively or in addition, we could merge Introductions and general (and events). since introductions and the welcome msg go hand-in-hand..
            - ~~Move any channels from "Discussions" and "Bureaucracy" that don't properly fit under "Projects".~~
                - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) by "merge in" you mean move or also combine?
                    - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Should have said "move". Fixed.
                - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) can you point to an example of this [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>)? [pong](<pong.md>) Not sure I see what you mean here. Prolly agree though already lol
                    - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Dropping this proposed change, as based on other feedback I'm thinking about things differently now.
    ## Voice
        Voice channels (and associated text channels).
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Voice Channels" ‚Üí "Voice".
                - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) üëçstreamlining is good
    ## Projects
        Currently active internal __and__ externally-facing projects. 
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) maybe have separate groups for internal and external projects
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) My thought was to mix them together, as I don't think we have that many... But I don't have a strong opinion.
                - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) could be helpful to keep separate. thinking of public projects in a channel that will eventually also include üí∏gig projects üí∏?
                - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) suggest deferring this to after we get a second paid project, since I don‚Äôt like creating empty or singleton things. Also, I‚Äôm thinking the categories may not remain that clean. For eg. [Astonishing Stories](<Astonishing Stories.md>) got some budget out of [Neurofuturama](<Neurofuturama.md>) tithe.
                    - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i think "paid" does not matter. inwards or outwards facing does
        ### Proposed Changes
            - ~~Merge in any channels from "Discussions" and "Bureaucracy" that don't properly fit under "Plaza".~~
                - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) Hmmm ü§îNot sure about this. Have liked the Bureaucracy as a home for internal structural-type conversations. Won't lumping them all together create quite a long list? [pong](<pong.md>) [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>)
Perhaps drop a proposed new list in simple text here so that we can see what the new look would be? ¬ª [Draft Revised Discord Channels Proposal v1](<Draft Revised Discord Channels Proposal v1.md>)[Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>)any solution which does not require clicking
                    - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Dropping this proposed change, as based on other feedback I'm thinking about things differently now.
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[collaborations](<collaborations.md>)` to "Discussions"
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[subscribe-projects](<subscribe-projects.md>)` to "Plaza"
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[infrastructure](<infrastructure.md>)`, `[production](<production.md>)`, `[bots-and-automation-](<bots-and-automation-.md>)ü§ñ`, and `[yc-marketing](<yc-marketing.md>)` from "Bureaucracy" to "Projects"
            - ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Make project channels __only__ visible to people who have the appropriate project role (reduces clutter)
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) See [Jordan Peacock](<Jordan Peacock.md>)'s work in classifying things: https://www.notion.so/Yak-Collective-Reaction-Roles-09be0f1e7e4f492ba1cf5604a600c31d
    ## ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Internal Projects
        - Currently active internally-facing projects. 
        - ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Bureaucracy" ‚Üí "Internal Projects".
            - Move any internal (non-project) discussions to "Discussions" or "Plaza", as appropriate.
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Based on the feedback, it seems like it would be better to pursue an internal/external project split. Example moves:
                    - `[admin-talk](<admin-talk.md>)` ‚Üí "Discussions"
                    - 
                    - 
    ## ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Discussions
        - Discussion and information channels with a more targeted audience.
            - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Just as this revision makes a distinction between "internal" and "external" projects, it resurrects the "Discussions" sections as an internal counterpart to "Plaza". Conceptually: "Plaza" is like a Roman Forum -- announcements happen there, public calendars are maintained, someone's writing "help wanted" ads in chalk, etc. "Discussions" are conversations (that may or may not be "public") that would instead be held indoors -- coffee shop philosophy, topical conversation that people may or may not care about, non-project planning, etc.
        - ### Proposed Changes
            - Move channels from "Bureaucracy" to "Discussions" as appropriate (basically, all channels not listed as being moved elsewhere)
                - [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) suggestions:
                    - plaza
                        - move lounge from discussion to plaza
                        - move takegigleavegig from buraeucracy to plaza
                        - move new-to-consulting from discussion to plaza
                    - basically general purpose channels that we might want to promote for users to find a place to discuss should go in plaza. 
                        - tempted to say to downgrade experiments-log to bureaucracy or discussion ? it's not really clear what it's purpose is 
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Basically:
                    - "^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[infrastructure](<infrastructure.md>)`, `[production](<production.md>)`, `[bots-and-automation-](<bots-and-automation-.md>)ü§ñ`, and `[yc-marketing](<yc-marketing.md>)` from "Bureaucracy" to "Projects""
                    - "^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Move `[yaktalk-content](<yaktalk-content.md>)` from "Bureaucracy" to "Plaza""
                    - Everything else gets moved to "Discussions"
    ## ^^New [December 20th, 2020](<December 20th, 2020.md>)^^ Bureaucracy
        - This category will be deleted.
    ## Incubator
        A place for new channels to find their legs. Or not.
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Probationary Channels" ‚Üí "Incubator".
            - [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) move any proposed or hibernating projects into Incubator, so Projects section only has active projects. If a user clicks into any channel in project section, it would be active. 
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) This is what "Archives" (below) is for.
    ## Archives
        ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Old channels, put out to pasture.
            - All channels in the "archives" should have the "send messages" permission disabled.
            - All channels in the "archives" should have the following appended to their description: "You can propose resurrecting this channel in `[create-destroy-channels](<create-destroy-channels.md>)`."
        ### Proposed Changes
            - Rename "Archived" ‚Üí "Archives".
            - Make sure that all channels in this section have the "send messages" permission disabled.
            - Existing channels should be [reviewed to determine if they are still alive](((qI9wDK8cG))) and moved to the archives as appropriate.
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) each should have a new title starting with "if you want this channel to come back to life do XXX"
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Maybe this should be in the channel description?
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Proposed text: "All channels in the "archives" should have the following appended to their description: "You can propose resurrecting this channel in `[create-destroy-channels](<create-destroy-channels.md>)`.""
# Channel Lifecycle
    ## Birth
        - New channels are proposed in `create-destroy-channels`. All active yaks, made yaks, and yak shavers can propose new channels.
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) interesting idea from pie slicing - opening channels for a predefined period of time.
        - A channel that receives at least 3 "thumbs up" from different active yaks, made yaks, or yak shavers is born into the "Incubator".
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i think 3 are enough for incubator.
                - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Changed from 5 ‚Üí 3
        - ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Channels in the incubator must show sustained interest for 1 month to be promoted to "Plaza", "Discussions", "Projects", or "Voice" (as appropriate).
            __Sustained interest__ means posts from at least 3 yaks, with an __average__ (for the entire channel) of at least 1 post per day and no more than 1 week (for the entire channel) between any two posts.
                - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i say 3 yaks. and 1 week, not 3 days. there are holidays, you know
                    - [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Change made
        - Channels in the incubator that do not show sustained interest are [archived](((qI9wDK8cG))).
    ## Life
        - ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Channels live in "Plaza", "Discussions", "Projects", or "Voice", as appropriate.
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i feel having more categories would be helpful
            - [Jenna Dixon](<Jenna Dixon.md>) I'm confused on this [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) [pong](<pong.md>) 
Are you proposing to put [Discussions](<Discussions.md>) and [Bureaucracy](<Bureaucracy.md>) under [Projects](<Projects.md>)? 
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) Originally I was trying to eliminate "Discussions" and "Bureaucracy", but now it's a bit more nuanced.
    ## Death
        - ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Yak shavers will monitor channels for signs of inactivity, culling inactive channels at least once per month. A message noting that the channel is scheduled for deletion will be posted in that channel at least one week in advance.
            - ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ An __inactive channel__ is one which has averaged less than 1 message per day over __both__ the last 30 days __and__ last week. (In other words, `$activity 30` shows has both "total messages" < 30 __and__ the last weekly message count < 7.) Bot-based channels (`[yaktalk-content](<yaktalk-content.md>)`, `[events](<events.md>)`, and `[subscribe-projects](<subscribe-projects.md>)`) and channels in the incubator are exempt from this requirement.
                - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) note new "$activity" command for yak_shaver
                - Conversation...
                - [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) i think this is too low of a bar. proposing it should be something like avg 10msg/week. or if we want it lower 20 msg/ month 
                    - Should send a weekly message activity note with warnings 
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) I still think we want to look at this over 1 month. I've updated the criteria that's a bit more in line with Darren's proposal. But maybe still too complicated?
        - ^^Updated [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ Channels can also be culled if there is a proposal to do so in `[create-destroy-channels](<create-destroy-channels.md>)` that receives at least 6 "thumbs up" from different active yaks, made yaks, or yak shavers, ~~at least 2 of which have posted in the channel in the last month~~.
            - [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>) Better to "vote to save" with a low bar, we need to prioritize reducing the number of channels. would take the form of "üíÄ The channel "channel name" has low activity and has been scheduled for archival. upvote this post the save the channel, anything with at least 3 votes will be spared." 
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) I think what you're getting at is the intent of the previous bullet, where we actively cull channels (this has been expanded a bit now). The intent of this is to provide an option to remove a channel for something __other__ than inactivity. I've updated to make it a __little__ easier to kill a channel, but I think this option should be harder than the "automatic" cull for inactivity.
        - Culled channels are moved to the "Archives", and have their "send messages" permission disabled.
            [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i would consider a temporary "being retired" category for a few weeks. and/or a post to members saying a channel is about to be retired, any objections.
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) I've added a note that a channel scheduled to be culled for inactivity should have a message sent to it at least one week beforehand. Does this seem sufficient?
    ## Resurrection
        - Any channel can be resurrected from the "Archives" by the same process by which it is born ¬ª "Birth"
            - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) i feel resurrection should be easier
                - ^^New [December 19th, 2020](<December 19th, 2020.md>)^^ [Nathan Acks](<Nathan Acks.md>) It's sufficient in the current proposal to be born with only three votes. I'm reluctant to make it __too__ easy to be resurrected, as that seems like a potential recipe to create too many zombies (resurrected channels that never see much activity and need to be killed again).
        - Resurrected channels have the same 1-month probationary period as newborn channels.
