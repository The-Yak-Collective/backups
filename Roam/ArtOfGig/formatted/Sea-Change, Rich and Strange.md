- ### __Rethinking globalization, reshoring, and automation__
- **Brief:** Containerisation has been a disruptive force, radically transforming manufacturing industry and supply chains worldwide.  Covid, Automation and increasing Nationalism are among the forces challenging existing supply chains today.  Supply chains are robust to small day-to-day variations.  Robustness to disruptive changes requires whole business awareness, up to and including product design.  We produce a slide deck on scenarios for supply chain disruption, for a future in which there are radical changes to supply chains.
- **Purpose:** For any company that has a supply chain and wants to explore how that supply chain might change.  This is an 'entry deck'.  It is used as part of touting for business for 1-1 strategic work with a company on their supply chain.
- **Deck structure:**
    - 12 contributors + an illustrator, for 14 modules of 3 to 4 slides each.
