- # Outline
    - Mapping possible future scenarios to create worlds for speculative fiction. Combines updated thinking on previous proposals [Speculative Fiction for the reboot ](<Speculative Fiction for the reboot .md>) and [Post-COVID scenario set](<Post-COVID scenario set.md>)
    - **Leads:** [Sachin Benny](<Sachin Benny.md>) & [Amanda Reeves](<Amanda Reeves.md>)
    - **Referees:** [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>) & [Reanna Browne](<Reanna Browne.md>)

- # Process
    - ## Phase 1: Develop scenarios (3 weeks)
        - ### 1.1 Respond to prompts to create future fragments (1 week)
            - Collaborators participating in this phase will be provided with 1-3 unique prompts to which they will individually respond to, describing a fragment of a possible future that could emerge from the present
            - Each prompt contains three components: an arc, a domain, and a mood - sourced from [The Thing From The Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/)
                - **Arc:** the story arc of this future, based on [Dator's Four Future Archetypes](http://www.foresightguide.com/dator-four-futures/). These are:
                    - **Growth:** a future in which progress (as we know it) has continued; this future is much like today only more so
                    - **Collapse:** a future in which society as we know it has come apart
                    - **Discipline: ** a future in which order is deliberately coordinated or imposed
                    - **Transformation:** a future in which a profound historical evolution has occurred
                - **Domain:** the focal context of your fragment; it might be a location, industry, or topic
                - **Mood:** the emotional tone for your fragment
            - **Example prompts:**
                - Collapse + family + wonder
                - Discipline + learning + melancholy
                - Discipline + wealth + disgust
                - Grow + equality + excitement
                - Transform + intellectual property + wellbeing
            - Collaborators can indicate the top 3 domains that bump into their direction of maximal interestingness during sign up; the other elements of the prompt (arc & mood) will be provided.
        - ### 1.2 Map future fragments from sooner to later (1 week)
            - Collaborators come together to arrange their future fragments on a [Harman Fan](https://www.slideshare.net/wendyinfutures/future-of-universities-an-example-of-scenario-building-using-the-harman-fan), organising them in chronological order from sooner to later in relation to one another
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2Fw7saUNUORq.png?alt=media&token=18f042bd-a652-4d89-9838-ad4010557247)
        - ### 1.3 Link up fragments to create scenarios (1 week)
            - Using this map, many different pathways can be traced between fragments in different time horizons
            - Collaborators can individually and/or collaboratively explore different pathways to find those that provide the most interesting material for turning into speculative fiction. There may be tensions in the transitions between different snippets that require some creative fleshing out - these can make for juicy material for exploring a world
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F64-OAjyL_k.png?alt=media&token=c116f922-457e-45b8-9b04-e52f6eeea293)
    - ## Phase 2: Create speculative fictions (3 weeks)
        - Pick a scenario and develop a piece of speculative fiction around
        - Pick a narrative framework for your speculative fiction

            - **Your Speculative fiction could arrive in many forms:**
                - Short story / essay eg: [Sort by Controversial](https://web.archive.org/web/20200121045328/https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/)
                - Comics/cartoons
                - Code/interactive such as Simler, Up and down the ladder of abstraction
                - Podcast / spoken word recording
        - ### 2.1 Strawman sprint (1 week)
            - Develop idea and first draft of the piece
            - Around the end of the first week, set up some time with your editors - this will be project leads, referees and any other experts to test and refine your thinking. We'll try to follow the [Pixar Braintrust ](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/inside-the-pixar-braintrust)model for this
        - ### Steelman sprint (2 weeks)
            - Strengthening your fiction into a final draft, editing in consultation with editors & referees
        - ## Phase 3: Collate & share (2 weeks)

        - (4) any additional information you want to include on the page (currently will appear under the stories)

            - __answer: tbd__
        - (5) go-live date for the project page

            - __answer: tbd. Some art may be ready by the end of the week.__
        - (6) story content itself, with each story having: (a) title, (b) author, (c) text + images, (d) 1 sentence teaser, (e) go-live date for that story (if different than the project as a whole)

we can iterate through layouts, etc. since there hasn't been a lot of feedback, i'm assuming right now that things more-or-less look good, which means that i can drop content in pretty quickly. ideally, we should probably have content ready ~1 week ahead of time (and least 2 - 4 days) so folks can look at it and decide tweaks.

iirc, part of the idea was for these to go out in yak talk. in that case, we'll need to decide whether yak talk should link to the story on the site (in which case i don't need to do anything except get all concerned the links where stories will go), or if story cards should link to yak talk archive pages (in which case my guess is that the newsletter will need to go out first, and then i'll need to do a quick rebuild so that i'm using the right archive link)
