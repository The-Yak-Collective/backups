- Myers-Briggs was a personality system designed to place women in jobs during the war.  We're in a similar situation now: both individuals and companies will find they don't know where they fit, and need some guidance on how their strengths play in the new normal
- I propose a lightweight repurposing of Jungian typology to apply to the new reality, using cognitive functions to uncover blindspots and opportunities.
- Questions to ponder:
    - How does every personality survive and thrive with the new VUCA? 
    - What are the personalities of the tools my company uses?  Who in my company is thriving with these tools?  Who need more support or different tools?
    - How do I build a culture resilient to the new normal?  What strengths does my team have?  What are we missing?
- What we could create
    - Slide deck of real world stories by cognitive function
    - A personality test that returns a new normal narrative for you based on your strengths
    - A prediction of the blindspots in your company based on personality analysis of your C-level team

- [Benjamin P Taylor - London](<Benjamin P Taylor - London.md>) I could contribute a Viable Systems Model perspective on personal identity - integration of executive function, planning, and autonomic systems. It would also be interesting to look at this from a group identity perspective - the fracturing and rebuilding of identities (personal and collective) in the breakdown of Yugoslavia
- With record high unemployment and more time, more people are thinking seriously about their side hustle. Some of the same rules apply: be a gold miner or make and sell pickaxes, but the actual choices that represent gold and pickaxes are different. This seems like it would be popular content, if produced. - [Isaac Wyatt](<Isaac Wyatt.md>)
- Could be cool to completely upend the 'personality test' model through something like this as well - [Alex Dobrenko](<Alex Dobrenko.md>)
- Interested to learn more about this and see where I can contribute. - [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)
- In the same vein of jungian typology, Venkat's Gervais principle also maps office workers into archetypes. Perhaps this might be something interesting considering the work-oriented nature of the Yak Collective? Given the VUCA of Covid-19, I'll hazard that a skill sociopaths (or whatever archetype thrives in VUCA) will develop is the ability to believe anything they want to believe. This is distantly related to "bluepilling" from the matrix/4chan sphere as well as something Robert Caro wrote about LBJ in his biography of him. Instead of Mckinseyian "Find the truth through complicated math+statistics", find the optimal action and then justify whatever leads to it as the truth. - [Jayes](<Jayes.md>)
