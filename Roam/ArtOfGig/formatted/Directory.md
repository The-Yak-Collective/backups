- {{[Benito Berretta](<Benito Berretta.md>)}} Minimalist version: just insert a page with your name in alphabetical order (by last name), and then do what you like with that page. 
- High-usability version (allows people to read your page embedded within this page instead of jumping around):
    - Put a summary sentence/paragraph on your page. Create all additional content on your page indented under the first paragraph.
    - Copy the block ref of that summary paragraph
    - Embed (don't just copy)the block under your name on this page
        - Indented under your name on this page, start typing ```html
{{embed: ((Trivedi Girish))}}``` and then paste your block ref. It should end up looking something like this: ```clojure
{{embed: ((((Hello, my name is Girish Trivedi and Iam based in New Delhi , India. Iam a Consultant focused around technology, Media and Telecom vertical. I work on Growth strategies, Got to market strategies and Segmentation projects. I am also a transition coach for professionals in transition and on my way towards becoming ICF( International Coach Federation) certified coach.                 ))))}}```This will embed that summary paragraph and anything else under it here on this page. You can then edit it in either place.
