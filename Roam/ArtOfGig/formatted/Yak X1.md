- **[build team leader](<build team leader.md>):** [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>)
- **[other team members](<other team members.md>):** TBD
- **[design](<design.md>):**
    - right now looks like design will be a legged robot, with a twist (literally, as a joint) that allows at least some of the legs to meet as arms or at least pinchers
    - the goal is that we are not making just a rover, but rather a bot that can also move but also do stuff. it seems to make sense that at least some bot parts be as multi-use as possible
    - looks like it will be based on hiwonder spiderpi, but checking into another design
- **[other stuff](<other stuff.md>):**
    - working with [Eric Platon](<Eric Platon.md>) on software and hardware control of spider pi
    - working with [Eric Platon](<Eric Platon.md>) on multi-user software
