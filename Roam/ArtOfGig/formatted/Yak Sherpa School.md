- # Welcome to __The Yak Collective__ **Sherpa School**.
    - ## What's a sherpa? 
        - "a member of a Himalayan people living on the borders of Nepal and Tibet, renowned for their skill in mountaineering."
        - Sherpas help Yaks Yak. 
        - Sherpas unblock the Collective, restoring flow. 
        - Sherpas help talent and work discover each other. 
        - Sherpas nourish our culture and values.
    - You know you're a Yak Sherpa when you... 
- ## Climb the Yak Road 
    - ### Know the paths.
        - Paths lead to destinations, so know Yakdom, the better to help people choose paths. What are the paths?
    - ### Help travelers pack.
        - What attitudes and expectations should you bring on your trip? 
        - What to leave behind? 
        - Example packs? Meditations for starting particular journeys? 
    - ### Help stumbling Yaks rise up. 
        - Projects fail to lift off, never getting critical mass. Others fail to deliver outcomes. Can you help pull the right people to the ideas and initiatives that are right for them? Can we create affordances that help people do this for themselves? 
        - Yaks sometimes wander from the collective, forgetting us. Other times poor communication or teamwork reject them. How can you bring back those who fall, who leave, who break our flow? 
- ## Along the road...
    - ### Show the shrines. 
        - Honor the spirits that trod this path before us. 
        - The fallen, the saints, the sinners. 
    - ### Teach the history. 
        - How did we get here? (Chronology)
        - What have we overcome? (Narrative)
        - What forces shaped us? (Analysis)
    - ### Pause to appreciate the beauty. 
        - Recognize and appreciate works of great insight, of discipline, of teamwork, of craft, of effort. 
    - ### Sing the Yak songs. 
        - Or write them. Celebrate our failures and successes, our comradery and foolishness, our pluck and courage. 
    - ### Guide new Sherpas
        - Encourage Yaks to Sherpa, even a bit here and there. 
        - Acknowledge acts of Sherpa giving, calm, grit, and wisdom.
