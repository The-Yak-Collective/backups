- related to Venkat's point about identity and "do vs be," I think that teams need this mix of skills to succeed, because working in new areas often requires deep insight in one area (eg technology) in order to apply it in other areas that you understand functionally. An individual with such a skill set is valuable, but a high-performing team with one is even better. How can we talk about what it takes to constitute those teams, and what it looks like to do so, and how to know which areas require what levels of depth? It usually starts with an *insight* that straddles a deep knowledge and a useful knowledge. - [David McDougall](<David McDougall.md>)
