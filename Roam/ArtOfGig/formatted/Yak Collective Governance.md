        - "There are not that many leaders yet who have internalized this new paradigm and can adopt the coherent set of management practices it calls for. But even when you have such a leader, there often remains a risk one level up: the board of directors. It's happened with more than one of these new organizations that the board at some point pulled the plug: "This is all working really well, but this is all a mystery to us. Let's put in a CEO that will do that top-down thing we understand and trust."
        - [Frederic Laloux](<Frederic Laloux.md>)
        -  [Systemic Logic for Platform Business Models, by Julia A. Fehrer, Herbert Woratschek and Roderick J. Brodie]()https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/44885/Fehrer-Woratschek-Brodie_2018_A%2bSystemic%2bLogic%2bfor%2bPlatform%2bBusiness%2bModels.pdf?sequence=30)
            - This is a groundbreaking article, in my view. The authors are kind of dancing around the fact that you have to throw most of what you think you know about management out of the window. We can discuss it either first or later, because other authors are touching upon some of the same ideas.
    -  [Do you need a business ecosystem?](https://www.bcg.com/ru-ru/publications/2019/do-you-need-business-ecosystem)
        - "The concept of business ecosystems is not new. Indeed, the large fairs in many medieval cities at which merchants came together and exchanged goods for a given period of time each year can be regarded as early forms of ecosystems. Similarly, as early as the fourteenth century, the city of Prato, Italy, had established a textile industry as an ecosystem of independent craftsmen specializing in weaving, carding, spinning, fulling, and dyeing, and orchestrated by powerful wool merchants that acted as the trading hubs of the system and provided critical functions of production coordination, quality control, and even financing."
        - It is thought provoking and invites a reading about medieval marketplaces.
        - The article above is a part of a series, that include:
            - https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/why-do-most-business-ecosystems-fail

    - [McKinsey is also interested](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/new-evidence-for-the-power-of-digital-platforms)
    - 5. The Business of Platforms is an excellent book by Michael Cusumano, et al.
    - https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-business-of-platforms-michael-a-cusumanoannabelle-gawerdavid-b-yoffie
    - It also reminds us that platforms are nothing new. A newspaper can be considered as such, or Yellow Pages, or Microsoft Windows.
    - A shorter article based on the book is here:

    - 6. Len Rachitsky recently had an excellent 4 part series on modern platforms:
    - **Chicken or Egg Problem **

    - https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-kickstart-and-scale-a-marketplace-2e5
    - 7. This piece is about a hierarchy of marketplaces. It refers to some thinking of Bill Gurley, among other things, who deserves a lot of attention.
    - https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/the-hierarchy-of-marketplaces-introduction-and-level-1-983995aa218e
    - 8. An entrepreneur Fabrice Grinda also has a lot of good ideas about platforms/marketplaces.
    - https://fabricegrinda.com/transcript-of-all-things-marketplaces/
    - 9. Finally, there are some anecdotal evidence on what's going on in Asia, which is very interesting.

    - Another Addition: A short reading on medieval guilds https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/
or something similar
    - There is also a lot of literature on this topic behind the paywalls, including 
1. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360368?seq=1
2. https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-art-of-solidarity-in-the-middle-ages-9780198201571?cc=us&lang=en&
3. https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300169072/markets-and-marketplaces-medieval-italy-c-1100-c-1440
    - This one is free and also interesting
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231792017_Guilds_Reappraised_Italy_in_the_Early_Modern_Period
And the author (Luca Mocarelli) looks like a fun person to invite as a (surprise) guest to our group chat.
