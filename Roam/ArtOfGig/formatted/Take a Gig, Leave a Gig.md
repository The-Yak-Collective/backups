to look at how to get the responses into analysable form? I need to have each tweet (and any chain of tweets it generates) in a table so I can group and analyse, and be able to link back to the original response somehow.

        - It's going to be targeted towards phones and it's going to take the form of a zine/low budget documentary/graphic novel/puppet show/radio play, featuring deepfake phone calls from trump, AR elements, etc, with a bit of a "weird powerpoint made by a strange hermit" vibe/Daniel Johnston type of thing. 
        - I'm looking to work with a wide variety of artists to give it a bit of a schizophrenic style, so I'm on the hunt for illustrators (particularly on the hunt for a pixel artist), animators, crafters/hobbyists (a needlepoint maker?), a good sound designer, musicians. 
        - Having worked with the NFB before, expect to be paid well below market rates, and while everything looks like it's moving forward with them it's not totally locked in yet so this is PRELIMINARY but if you want to talk more about it my email is dschorno@gmail.com
