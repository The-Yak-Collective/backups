- **Existential Hope** is the antithesis to Existential Risk or Existential Angst. It  encapsulates all activities working towards a positive, clearly defined vision of the future: whether CRISPR trees that draw-down carbon, [Open Source Lunar Settlements](https://openlunar.org/), or [ferociously stepping into becoming a multi-planetary species.](https://blueorigin.com/)

    - [Existential Hope](https://www.existentialhope.com/) is a project by the Foresight Institute that the author ([Andy Wilkinson](<Andy Wilkinson.md>)) is unsubtly attempting to define as an industry.
    - **In their words:**
        - "Many projects are dedicated to identifying the threats to human existence but very few offer guidance on what to aim for instead. The goal of this one is to map the space of both peril and promise which lie before us with the hope that such knowledge empowers each of us to navigate towards grand futures."
        - "In other words, our mission is to generate the common knowledge to catalyze directed coordination towards beautiful futures."
