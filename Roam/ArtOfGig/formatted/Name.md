Out of the box we can have~~ `Nathan-Acks` -- ~~ie I'll have to find a way to lower case the names. I also would suggest~~ `Acks-Nathan` ie `Lname-Fname` ~~to make sorting the list in the backend with a click possible.~~ hold this thought, I may be misunderstanding what you are suggesting above. ID should __not__ use actual names, will get Knack to autogenerate a non-name UID √
