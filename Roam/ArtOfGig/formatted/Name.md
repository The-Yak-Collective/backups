## [Schema | member data](<Schema | member data.md>)
- [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) but i _also_ want the discord name _and_ the name format we use in the website (`firstname-lastname`) because there are some conversion issues and Issume, for example, we will use this name when we give a website a name
    - **[Name](<Name.md>):**
