        - I did my PhD in computational neuroscience, making electrophysiological recordings from cells in the retina to inform models of computation and signal processing. More broadly, my work was answering the question of how circuits of neurons compute useful things. In terms of neurotech, I've developed a novel silicon micropipette for single-neuron recording, as well as algorithms to sort spikes from multi-electrode arrays that record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. I also designed and built a pieozelectric sensor to detect nanoscale motion from neurons. Turns out they inflate and deflate when they spike :)

Interest- constantly learning & reading about different facets of the brain...over the quarantine have probably pulled ~400 journal articles, of which I've read maybe 10%

- [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) suggest deferring this to after we get a second paid project, since I don’t like creating empty or singleton things. Also, I’m thinking the categories may not remain that clean. For eg. [Astonishing Stories](<Astonishing Stories.md>) got some budget out of [Neurofuturama](<Neurofuturama.md>)

## [Old Forms of Justice in a New World ](<Old Forms of Justice in a New World .md>)
- (1 person) **Court of Public Opinion**: what does it look like if cancelling - public opinion - is the main form of social justice? This is how it was in Ancient Rome, where airing others' transgressions of social norms was normal and citizens understood their societal role as judge and jury. What does it mean if cancel culture extends past the Weinsteins (professional/cultural gatekeepers) to the Amy Coopers (mid-level business management) of the world? Does it go further? What ways will we measure community sentiment in the future that aren't considered today (Kernel ([Neurofuturama](<Neurofuturama.md>))
