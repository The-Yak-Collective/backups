-  I make collaborative paintings with Drew Beattie (http://drewbeattiestudio.com/) and institutional performances, most notablly a proposal for Kanye West to run for mayor of Chicago on a municipal market communist platform back in 2014.

-  Right now I'm in Thailand working on "Infinite Thailand Strategies" - a hypothetical consulting firm designed to help the Kingdom of Thailand vault up the value scale. Looking for help on this one, and also looking to help anyone who needs any loopy/lateral thinking.
