- Love this, and agree it's a more apt metaphor/visual for it. I think if we want to sell organizations on the value of this (per [Darren Kong](<Darren Kong.md>) comment on Discord), we need to find some bridging terminology that is familiar in that world without sacrificing what you describe here.

- In the spirit of starting with what we've got and optimizing later, I'd propose that simply adding better structure to [Directory](<Directory.md>) would be a good next action vs. adding another tool to the mix. I volunteer to help with this. [Scott Allen](<Scott Allen.md>)

- ~~A Twitter list of members would be helpful both in making it easier to engage with other yaks (vs. relying on Twitter's algorithms) and help increase visibility. I started to do one on my personal account, but then realized it should be on @yak_collective. I volunteer to set it up and help maintain it if I can get access to the Twitter account~~—[Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>)? [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)?. ~[Scott Allen](<Scott Allen.md>)
