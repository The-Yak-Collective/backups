- One of my own strong interests is in time perception, and one of the fascinating things about aging is that there are clear differences in how older people think versus younger based on the perceived time-left-to-live horizon (see Linda Cartensen research at Stanford). Young people end up with the same "old" time horizon attitudes when diagnosed with a terminal illness, or caught up in war or pandemic or other conditions where the future seems foreshortened. So if you can __artificially__ create this foreshortened horizon effect with neural techniques you'd have a neurological [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) tech [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- " A subtler collision force is neurotech itself... the original "traffic jam" model is not cars+another trend, but isolated car ownership --> pervasive car ownership and infrastructure shift. So a homogeneous pattern of traffic jam = everybody has some access to neurotech, either through data, or NaaS, or the devices themselves, and infrastructure has evolved to support it.

## [Shreeda Segan: Death Ways](<Shreeda Segan: Death Ways.md>)
- I’d really like to learn more about the subjective mental state of the last minutes. Does your life really flash in front of your eyes, etc? I can imagine a neuro-death ritual practice, where people die broadcasting their last mental states. Macabre perhaps but a sort of death-twitter where a kernel device broadcasts interpretations of last stages (emotions, memory region, pain...) -- [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

## [Summary: 26th May Brainstorm](<Summary: 26th May Brainstorm.md>)
- "For this whole cluster of folkways, the distinguishing factors are a) intimacy b) money being absent or secondary within the relationship. So a brain or connected set of brains is likely at its least individualistic. I’m wondering if there are shared patterns. For example you’ve got mirror neurons and empathy stuff. Could you have “cut and paste” empathy? Like if I’m feeling sad, the mood lighting in a family home turns blue and everyone else gets sad as well? Could such mechanisms be used across these relationships? In Futurama, there’s an episode where Bender gets an “empathy chip” so he feels whatever Leela is feeling for eg. We currently use indirect mechanisms like music or food to drive mood/emotion links." [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

The internet itself is a good example. It arrived in a way that's much bigger than anything imagined by William Gibson etc. but also somehow more boring/banal by the time it did." [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "I watched upload, pretty good... but I have to say, that's one of my impossibility hypotheses... due to hard problem of consciousness, I personally believe transferring identity to a different substrate is conceptually impossible/ill-posed" [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

Yes, for sure. I wrote a blog post based on that premise several years ago. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/03/06/immortality-in-the-ocean-of-infinite-memories/ " [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "Definitely I think high-fidelity AI-based copies of input/output behaviors of people will be possible by 2040... gpt2 already does an eerily good job tweeting like me. I think it may be possible to get primitive memory grafts/prosthetics by then, where at least at a vague level you can have your brain attached to somebody else's old memories in external-hard-drive mode." [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "There is a mega-collision going on across all the folkways I just realized. Just like the internet created a digital native/digital migrant divide where the natives are able to somehow process at 1-2 levels above the migrants (eg, it is second nature to check whether a thing is fake, it is instinctive to think in terms of virality etc etc), a neural "second nature" may emerge... and it may collide with the digital "second nature"... basically the classic transhumanist collision of digital extension of self vs. biological extension of self. So a book-end concept I may try to build out is that of a "neuronative vs. neuromigrant"..."  [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

"afaik, the main mode for going digital to neuro is in fact through the eyes or  ears. the tech for direct neural stimulation via intracranial electrodes is there of course, as is transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation, but it's kinda really limited to random things that happen to be accessible that way." [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

**Reminder: everything embargoed, if in doubt, don’t talk about it outside this group unless kernel has already gone public with it.**" [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- **"So in some key ways, the “product” in the initial phase is really the data rather than the devices. Whether offered NaaS or via small market device sales"** [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "I think 20y out we can assume PC in 1990 type penetration of devices. By then every middle manager had a PC and was using Excel type spreadsheets to manage work. With nascent email/internet use, and manu people sharing a PC at home it work" [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

Ie, they’ll generate the data, figure out financing/making money etc, getting researchers going, enabling startups to build off their data, all that is their problem. Our problem is: then what happens," [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- For naming ways, I’m mostly thinking of proper names of people. In fantasy fiction there’s the concept of “true names” for eg. Could unique neural patterns be used to name people by neurotype? Like “Joe Introvert” or something subtler? Another random connection that occurred to me is the Bouba/Kiki effect. Can the subjective feel of words become more important in how people, brands etc are named? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect  [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- **I started a [Collision Forces Brainstorm](<Collision Forces Brainstorm.md>) page. Please add to it.** If enough people choose similar collision forces to work with, we can create a bit of a macro view too. Though collision forces for folkways can be unique to that particular folkway. [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

and I think you can include video games in your scope. Could you command entire virtual armies subconsciously in big war-based video games? maybe integrate the Kernel helment with a VR helmet to create new kinds of "neuroVR games"? esports is already huge [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

Example: electric vehicle boom is a collision of 2 big trends: falling solar prices, and the development of lithium ion. Youtube etc are a collision of 2 trends: falling bandwidth costs, and improving CCD camera tech. Look for those serendipitous collisions that create wealth and value, not as much at negative ones that create conflict."  [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "fyi... neurofuturama dot org and dot com are available right now, and I pinged bryan in case they want to buy it and said I would if they didn't... they don't want to maintain another web property, so I'm going to buy on spec for us.

## [Summary: Brainstorm Questions](<Summary: Brainstorm Questions.md>)
- Kernel correlations at a symbolic level [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- "In general, I think looking to the periphery of utopian/dystopian ideas to the interesting dynamic underneath I think leads to more fertile speculations. Something about both the dystopian/utopian labels evaluating a thing seems to cauterize the imagination a bit, which is why I'm mostly not a fan of black mirror though many episodes are fun... it's gotcha narrativism". [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

A: Solving a problem/idea for a new era of technology/scale/miniaturization/cost-point is basically a new challenge and the old/prescient research is often not as useful as the pioneers wish/hope [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

A: Yes, that much is clear. It’s a big cost-down for some kinds of research, as well as feature expansion since you can be mobile instead of strapped into a huge machine. [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- Yep, often “internal consultants” tend to be part of a new capability initiative like six sigma and float around helping other teams acquire the capability as coaches. But be aware that such roles often mean “employee-ier than thou”. It may not serve as a bridge to free agency unless you acquire externally valuable certifications etc. Threading that needle is non-trivial. You want to rude something that’s both a broad industry trend and a local capability need, and position internally and externally (go to meetups, write blogs etc) at the same time [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

a good diagnostic question to ask is: who are you when you are NOT dependent on clients. Eg. you have a big quarter and end up with a big surplus that allows you to not work for 6 months or a year. What do you do? Any sort of prostitution/mercenary type metaphor will leave you directionless under surplus. So you want one that will give you a sense of direction under surplus [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- +1 to David’s point. I’ve never successfully structured a gig around a tool or idea just because I wanted to apply it or thought they needed it. The only thing you sell is solutions to problems. Creating problems corresponding to tools (in the good sense) is a mob for books rather than gigs.[Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- Think potential energy. Build up an asset and network over years. Don’t look for ways to generate leads from a cold start in weeks. What you do now might get you leads in 2021. Think leadgen with a min 12 month horizon - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

## [token](<token.md>)
- "One thought I had was that every voice chat mines coins in proportion to the number of people who attended, so 5 people in a 10 minute chat = 5 yak coins mined for eg. It's a proxy for growth in trust levels and takes actually non-fake participation to create. Similarly for collaborative output. 25 people contributing 2 slides each to a deck = say 50 yakcoins create" [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- it's a market waiting to be created... take all the weary, zoom-fatigued people and give them an online change of scenery #[Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)

- I’d suggest focusing on the content and perhaps actually running an “online offsite” or two in simulation mode, either with role players, or a willing guinea-pig company, before picking how to document it for potential paying clients. Nothing better than a validated playbook. #[Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
