- I've been a freelance data science and machine learning consultant for over 2 years now. I help reconcile open-ended R&D (infinite game) with product development lifecycles (finite game), get ego-driven ICs to work together, curate and label data at scale, and prototype software using deep learning for speech recognition, computer vision, weather prediction, chatbots, and search.

- What if we could factor out the effects of aging on the brain, and apply that filter to your current  thoughts? I.e. what would your future self say to your current self? [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

- "My anecdotal evidence from my time in academia is consistent with this small-world network view of neurotech. Program officers at funding agencies have ties to the academic labs they were trained in, which biases how the money flows and ultimately which collaborations persist or become important.  In terms of neurotech colliding with itself, you could get an Apple vs. Microsoft dynamic between competing visions of the neurotech ecosystem." [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

- "In terms of collisions with trends in AI, I think Kernel offers a way to cross the uncanny valley. You no longer need to label large quantities of data to get human-level performance in language modeling or computer vision. One can simply read the error signal from the brain directly and feed that back into the optimizer." [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

- "Another AI collision is in the area of Neural Architecture Search. Currently, decisions about how artificial neurons are wired together in deep neural nets are driven by intuition and trial/error, not as much by theory or principles. Neurotech enables looking at nature to inspire the structure of deep learning models, which could unlock traditionally hard tasks for computers such as complex pattern recognition, memory, and more. Riffing on the "find stuff in nature" idea, could neurotech lead to serendipitous discoveries like the "penicillin" for depression or anxiety?" [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

A: From [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

A: I think we will be able to model circuits of 100 to 1000s of neurons in specific brain regions, and that these circuits will produce signals that are measurable non-invasively. The models can be developed with invasive single-cell recording techniques and then used for prediction. [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

A: I think the limiting factor here is our understanding of the brain. Not sure if anyone has calculated the rate of discovery for neuroscience, but the balance is still heavily towards the unknown i.e. that we know far less about the neuroscience than what is possible to be known. [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)

- Speaking of limitations and mental models, I think the "brain as a computer" metaphor is limiting - you can't separate the "software" from the "hardware" [Nikhil Deshmukh](<Nikhil Deshmukh.md>)
