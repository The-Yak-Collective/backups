- I'd like this to be more actionable than something like a deck that has all of the right answers. Even a playbook seems less than what I'd want. A playbook could work if it gets super tactical; ideally I might want something like... a play-along-at-home workshop? A bootcamp? Very open to ideas on this
- David, a few of us were starting to think on putting together a "Minimum Viable Workshop" aimed at executives based on 1 or more of the slides from the [Yak Deck v 1.0](<Yak Deck v 1.0.md>). Happy to pair with you on this. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)
- This draws a lot on [issue 10 of my newsletter Innovation at Scale](https://innovationatscale.substack.com/p/innovation-at-scale-10-making-effective) 
- **“All else being equal, the fastest company in any market will win.”** - Dave Girouard, [Speed as a Habit](https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/) 

... and __the team that is fastest is the team that makes the fastest effective decisions__.
- The thesis is this: for any business **speed is the only sustainable competitive edge**
    - Threats: 
        - Disruption (in the classical Clay Christensen definition) finds a way to threaten even the most established businesses. 
        - Large brand customer loyalty is minimized by niche brands, internet advertising, online retail
        - The physical infrastructures that our soceities are built on are changing, increasingly quickly (see: coal from 2010-2030, oil and gas 2020-2040)
    - Opportunities:
        - Startups can replace existing companies by iterating faster to serve customer needs
    - Solutions/Principles - ways to increase decision velocity:
        - Subsidiarity & Delegation 
            - Andy Grove's __Task Relevant Maturity__: when you can delegate, when you should get hands on with your employees
            - Subsidiarity: the principle that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority
                - Important governance principle for the EU, the USA, Catholic social teaching
            - Tim Ferris -- any decision that can solved for less than $X is delegated to frontline employees. 
                - in practice, that number has kept raising 
                - they can be trusted to make mostly the right call, and the risk is less dangerous than the need to escalate decisions to execs who should be focusing on higher-value decisions
        - Decision Types - knowing how much scrutiny to apply to decisions up front
            - Type 1 and Type 2 decisions - Bezos shareholder letter
                - "Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.

As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making __process__ on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention."
        - Timeboxed decisions
            - Learning from Eric Schmidt at Google, Girouard suggests that decisions __should be timeboxed in advance__, to cut off protracted debate, and to build in the responsiveness required to decide __at the right time__ rather than attempt to perfect the decision in advance.
            - “The process of making and remaking decisions wastes an insane amount of time at companies. **The key takeaway: WHEN a decision is made is much more important than WHAT decision is made.”**
        - 
        - Commitment, not consensus
            - "Disagree and commit" 
            - Consensus is not a requirement for effective decisions, but teams do need to commit to executing a decision once it has been made. 
            - (Reversible) decisions first, data after the fact. Shipping hypotheses: 
                - "High-velocity decisionmaking means spending less time building consensus, and more time shipping our best guess in order to learn the right answers __after the fact__ based on the actions of our customers." (from [IaS 10](https://innovationatscale.substack.com/p/innovation-at-scale-10-making-effective))
        - Decision velocity and Speed to value
            - Faster decisions mean a faster “Build-Measure-Learn” loop
        - OODA loops as buying time - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
        - Digital decisions =Digital decisions allow for data to be gathered right away
            - "__digital actions are fundamentally measurable__ in a way that many analog actions aren’t." (from [IaS 10](https://innovationatscale.substack.com/p/innovation-at-scale-10-making-effective))

- @David McDougall (GMT/BST) I just realized that whenever people (including Dave Girouard) talk about “speed as a source of competitive advantage”, they don’t really mean “speed”.  It can be interesting to explore, what do they really mean and why.

    - I have 2 quotes for you: ‘1) “Speed produces nothing in manufacturing,” Knudsen liked to say — which was one reason he eschewed the complicated time-and-motion studies of production gurus like William Taylor. “Accuracy is the only straight line to great production.”’ (Freedom’s Forge, which is 50% about Knudsen, Ford and GM veteran who should get more credit for mass production than Ford, and left presidency of GM to lead WW2 production mobilization) and 2) Special forces saying: “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.” The trick is not speed per se, but sufficient accuracy to eliminate all rework. Rework is the speed killer. Principle of getting inside OODA loops is similar. You don’t want to necessarily iterate faster than the adversary, you want to operate inside their decision cycle. You might be able to do that while being slower. Knudsen’s big innovation at Chevrolet, which allowed him to beat Ford (in a way beating himself because he set up Ford’s initial leadership) was annual model updates and mass customization of color choices. He got inside the customer’s decision cycle. Happy to contribute a bit to the project based on this line of thought.

        - I'm keen to work on this. Sounds like one point of focus would be identifying contexts where decisions are reversible. 
    - [Antoine Buteau](<Antoine Buteau.md>)
        - Probably discuss sensemaking in the context of speed. 
Sensemaking tends to be retrospective, but what you do when you are moving at full speed and sensemaking is done in action.

        - I'd be excited to contribute (5/28/20, I'm still excited)
        - That First Round article (and the resulting behavior), has been foundational for me and is something I point to over-and-over again.
        - My POV is first-person and operational
            - Speed for external gains 
                - Getting work done well amidst the ambiguity of early-stage startups
                - Learning quickly
            - Speed for internal gains 
                - Feeling like __progress is being made__
        - Another thought added 5/8 - speed as a russian nesting doll; your place in the org matters, similar to stewart brands ["pace layers"](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2)
            - you should be moving faster than the person above you
            - you should be moving slower than the person below you
        - 5/28/20 addition [a bias to action](https://medium.com/@henrysward/a-bias-to-action-4add3bd9ab77) blog post by Carta [Tyler Willis](<Tyler Willis.md>)
            - I’m particularly interested in how to unify “slow is smooth, smooth is fast” with “move fast and break things” as competing philosophies 
            - theory: the cost of running experiments is what drives this. in the physical world, high stakes mean that the elimination of rework is more valuable than raw speed. In the digital world, rework is often a nominal cost and feedback loop cycle speed is more valuable.
                - the more people are on a team / the more coordination there is, the more a digital effort looks physical. This is why places like Amazon prefer small teams.
                - Astro teller video below has choice examples of shipping to learn what to ship. I also did this at my company and can offer a case study example with a successful outcome
            - OODA loop + a “what should I value” guideline (or quiz) would be a good way to unify this.
            - I did a presentation on growth hacks in Paris in 2015 that might have nominal relevance to this.
            - lots of good quotes/lessons in Astro Teller’s recap of managing X https://youtu.be/JnxAiy4DqBg
    - [Murilo Loureiro](<Murilo Loureiro.md>)
        - Definitely, one of the critical topics for me. Reading the previous posts, the key challenges in shaping up this proposal would be i) how fast do you need to get? ii) how and when to build speed
        - There are many organizations that still see this topic as mindless execution by exerting pressure on every single level. As an example, I struggled mightily to convince the management on a shipyard about the point that speed of execution was directly related to the reduction of undetected non-conformities (and their related rework)
        - In other situations, speed was more related to acting early or developing options on unstructured or undefined areas of opportunity (such as driving student engagement during the academic semester). In this case, I have seen many organizations lose considerable time in waiting for definitive evidence to act upon problems in the making 
- Comments
    - Could use a baseline methodology with more complex ones as stretch goals. Otherwise it is hard for potential contributors to estimate contribution effort/commitment. — Venkat
