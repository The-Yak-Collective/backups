-  Create a container. Traditional offsites are geared to create a space in which people connect with each other and focus on strategic issues.
    - In remote meetings, your agenda competes with tantalizing online updates, kids fighting with each other in the next room and family pets doing whatever they do. 
    - Refresh your team norms and set the stage for productive conversations.
- Clarify expectations.
    - Don’t shy away from providing more prescriptive, clear guidance on what you want and don’t want during your online offsite. 
    - From clarity about the length of a check-in, to precision about the duration of a break, to meticulously crafting the questions you want addressed during a breakout discussion—set clear boundaries and give strong guidance.
- Cut the time in half. You’ve already learned that it’s difficult to sustain attention and maintain energy for an extended time. If your offsites are usually a day long, experiment with a morning offsite that runs between three and four hours. If necessary, do two mornings instead of a full day.
- Connect through screens
    - During our session, individuals also noted a dramatic difference in feeling connected when we made one simple change: we adjusted our cameras to reveal our heads, torsos and both hands. By seeing more than just talking heads, participants said they had a better sense of the humanity of those around them.
- Craft discussion sessions. Offsites typically comprise a half dozen to a dozen participants. Instead of having all conversations as a big group, consider separating into breakout sessions. Lean on technology. Many online video tools allow you to have separate breakout rooms.
- Curtail online materials. A quick way to lose participants’ attention is to share your screen and provide lots of online materials. I ran a half-day offsite for 19 people where we only showed two things online: instructions for an activity and suggested questions for their breakout groups. Instead, provide a soft copy of the materials for reference as they go into breakout discussions.
- Communicate with conveners. At the end of the first half-day of a two-part C-suite offsite, I realized a big gap from the in-person world: frequent, short check-ins with the CEO and CHRO during breaks. As a result, we regrouped a half hour before the next morning’s session and resumed the offsite with an updated plan.
