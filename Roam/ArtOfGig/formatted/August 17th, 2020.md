- Notes on Biophilia
    - Contemplating the restorative effect of working the soil in her own yard, Stuart-Smith writes that, “in the safe curtilage of the garden, I am in the kind of company that allows me to be alone and enter my own world.” When I read those words this spring, while sitting by my withered arugula on the terrace of the house where I have largely been confined, I reflected that my urge to sow seeds was about more than keeping my fridge stocked. Gardening provided a way of being alongside my mother, whom I could not visit, as she pottered, alone, in the space of my childhood... 
    - A garden can be a Winnicottian “in-between” space that allows the inner and the outer worlds to coexist simultaneously—“a meeting place for our innermost, dream-infused selves and the real physical world.” The meditative and repetitive aspects of gardening can function as a form of play for grownups

    - Transitioning to a largely soap-free 
- Quarantiny Homes (QuaranteenyHomes.com)
    - Riffing on the Forte Shelter has made me think about how to leverage tiny homes toward a [portal to 2019](<portal to 2019.md>)
    - Many individuals will likely pass through times when they need to quarantine (or 14-day-tine) (quattordicitine?)
        - The current canonical case is for those entering a new zone. Asian countries are fastidious about taking entrants directly from the airport to an isolated space, where a clamp down is enforced
        - A NOVEL, interesting, case: Purification rite in order to enter into close contact with others who have also proven themselves virus free
    - What would Proof of Health look like? Clean-chain
        - Certification that a person has:
            - Been isolated for the duration of the viral incubation period 
                - Analogous to [house arrest](<house arrest.md>)
                - Geofenced tracking of location
                - Motion sensitive cameras at the perimeter
                - Infrared monitoring inside the perimeter to detect any other life
            - Biomonitored throughout the isolation period
                - Temperature is a coarse grained metric, but still 
                - Swabbing daily would be another input
                - Fancier, more sophisticated biometrics could be integrated
        - Provisioning for the duration would need to avoid potential contamination. Simply stockpile 2 weeks worth of food, fresh & frozen. Even milk shelf life can last that long
    - How would the certificate be used?
        - Not very similar to immunity passports, though any certificate must not be seen as a medical certificate
            - Resources on Immunity Passports https://github.com/ChristopherA/Lists-of-High-Signal-Low-Noise-Links/blob/master/ImmunityCredentials-VerifiableClaims-COVID19.md[introduction-to-immunity-credentials--ics-](<introduction-to-immunity-credentials--ics-.md>)
        - Certification put on a blockchain, broadcast via BlueTooth, while preserving privacy
        - Analogous to envoy.com (a preregistration channel that collects NDA etc): Certificate must be read in order to enter [GREEN zone](<GREEN zone.md>) 
            - Example use cases: Burning Man (mask free); high touch conferences; corporate or college campuses
        - Upon completion of the certification, an autonomous vehicle could enter the quaranteeny zone, pick up the certified person, and directly transport them as a [portal to 2019](<portal to 2019.md>)
        - Don't break the clean chain 
    - Don't break the [clean chain](<clean chain.md>)
        - The purified state can only be certified so long as the person provably stays within a [GREEN zone](<GREEN zone.md>)
        - Geofenced beacons can continuously be updating the certificate, to establish that there's been neither and exit from nor a rupture in the perimeter
        - Weird aspects of inequality: The bearer of the certificate stands in a purified Brahmin state, while those lacking access to the certificate effectively become untouchable
- Quarenteeny Experiences as Retreats
    - Given the slab of time in isolation, passage through the portal may be considered a time of ritual initiation
    - Silent meditation retreats, cleanses and fasts might be one framing of the time
    - Sleep studies or other physical/pharmaceutical trials can potentially monetize the down time
    - Dedicated skill-building could be another frame that enriches the time: Learn to use Roam, Build a Second Brain, etc
    - Regimes that demand 2 to 4 hours a day might be right-sized. Instead of a long-distance airplane flight, the passage affords a useable transition to concentrate on specific facets of personal development
