- I'm a philosopher & philosophical life coach (est. 2019) in NYC. 

Before that, I dropped out of a PhD program in philosophy & education and worked as a non-technical person in tech.

- ~~Twitter~~   [Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>)

- ~~A Twitter list of members would be helpful both in making it easier to engage with other yaks (vs. relying on Twitter's algorithms) and help increase visibility. I started to do one on my personal account, but then realized it should be on @yak_collective. I volunteer to set it up and help maintain it if I can get access to the Twitter account~~—[Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>)?

## [Vlad Meh: Naming Ways, Magic Ways](<Vlad Meh: Naming Ways, Magic Ways.md>)
- Hey Vlad I'm just catching up on this convo so I don't know what other people chimed in on here, but I guess I see names as possibly developing an anachronistic kind of charm - like they aren't strictly necessary for communication purposes anymore but they might all feel like nicknames, or kind of pleasantly vestigial - [Pamela Hobart](<Pamela Hobart.md>)
