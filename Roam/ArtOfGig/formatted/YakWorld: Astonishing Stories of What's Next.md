- # Process
    - ## Phase 1: Develop scenarios (3 weeks)
        - ### 1.1 Respond to prompts to create future fragments (1 week)
            - Collaborators participating in this phase will be provided with 1-3 unique prompts to which they will individually respond to, describing a fragment of a possible future that could emerge from the present
            - Each prompt contains three components: an arc, a domain, and a mood - sourced from [The Thing From The Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/)
                - **Arc:** the story arc of this future, based on [Dator's Four Future Archetypes](http://www.foresightguide.com/dator-four-futures/). These are:
                    - **Growth:** a future in which progress (as we know it) has continued; this future is much like today only more so
                    - **Collapse:** a future in which society as we know it has come apart
                    - **Discipline: ** a future in which order is deliberately coordinated or imposed
                    - **Transformation:** a future in which a profound historical evolution has occurred
                - **Domain:** the focal context of your fragment; it might be a location, industry, or topic
                - **Mood:** the emotional tone for your fragment
            - **Example prompts:**
                - Collapse + family + wonder
                - Discipline + learning + melancholy
                - Discipline + wealth + disgust
                - Grow + equality + excitement
                - Transform + intellectual property + wellbeing
            - Collaborators can indicate the top 3 domains that bump into their direction of maximal interestingness during sign up; the other elements of the prompt (arc & mood) will be provided.
        - ### 1.2 Map future fragments from sooner to later (1 week)
            - Collaborators come together to arrange their future fragments on a [Harman Fan](https://www.slideshare.net/wendyinfutures/future-of-universities-an-example-of-scenario-building-using-the-harman-fan), organising them in chronological order from sooner to later in relation to one another

        - ### 1.3 Link up fragments to create scenarios (1 week)
            - Using this map, many different pathways can be traced between fragments in different time horizons
            - Collaborators can individually and/or collaboratively explore different pathways to find those that provide the most interesting material for turning into speculative fiction. There may be tensions in the transitions between different snippets that require some creative fleshing out - these can make for juicy material for exploring a world
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2F64-OAjyL_k.png?alt=media&token=c116f922-457e-45b8-9b04-e52f6eeea293)
    - ## Phase 2: Create speculative fictions (3 weeks)
        - Pick a scenario and develop a piece of speculative fiction around
        - Pick a narrative framework for your speculative fiction

            - **Your Speculative fiction could arrive in many forms:**
                - Short story / essay eg: [Sort by Controversial](https://web.archive.org/web/20200121045328/https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/)
                - Comics/cartoons
                - Code/interactive such as Simler, Up and down the ladder of abstraction
                - Podcast / spoken word recording
        - ### 2.1 Strawman sprint (1 week)
            - Develop idea and first draft of the piece
            - Around the end of the first week, set up some time with your editors - this will be project leads, referees and any other experts to test and refine your thinking. We'll try to follow the [Pixar Braintrust ](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/inside-the-pixar-braintrust)model for this
        - ### Steelman sprint (2 weeks)
            - Strengthening your fiction into a final draft, editing in consultation with editors & referees
        - ## Phase 3: Collate & share (2 weeks)
