                - how we launch the new projects — do this in parallel with above

                - How do we know that we are actually in a position to help? E. g. are we familiar with different channels that sci-fiction writers and publishers are using? Can we ramp up our presence there before the AS launch? How? Is it going to be helpful for YC as a whole? [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)
