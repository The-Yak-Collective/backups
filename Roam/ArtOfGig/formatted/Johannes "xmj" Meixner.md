- I looked into this at one point. Research retainer-based business models. Often found in accounting/tax prep/legal advice. Fee is after use. Subscription is for access, irrespective of using / or not. At one point I wondered if it'd be worthwhile to do systems administration / systems engineering (commonly smeared as DevOps these days) on a retainer-basis, but so far Cloudwork has proved more profitable - [Johannes "xmj" Meixner](<Johannes "xmj" Meixner.md>)
