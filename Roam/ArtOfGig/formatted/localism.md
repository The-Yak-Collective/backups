- [Thomas Verhagen](<Thomas Verhagen.md>): ironically, taking the perspective of 'cities' seems to invite associations between 'us' and 'them' as well. I know there is a research strand in (financial) [geography ](<geography .md>)that digs into the [exploitative](<exploitative.md>) [relationship](<relationship.md>) between major cities and their [marginalised](<marginalised.md>) hinterlands. I can give many examples from my own country (the Netherlands) and the tense relationship between the western cities (particularly Amsterdam) and the southern and eastern hinterlands. Much of the Brexit analyses dug into the [London](<London.md>) - periphery relationship as well, to not even mention the relationship between Paris and the rest of France. Maybe it might be more inclusive to look at this from a perspective of [localism](<localism.md>),
