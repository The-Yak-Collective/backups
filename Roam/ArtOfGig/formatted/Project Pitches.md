    - [Boutiques vs Marketplaces Wargames](<Boutiques vs Marketplaces Wargames.md>) Emergent boutiques and emergent marketplaces may be similar in size (pretty small), but they are essentially completely different organizations -- with different goals, different structures and different business models. 
In this project we want to explore this difference on a very practical level. We will try to design both business models and organizations for a very specific segment -- professional services -- and put them to test via wargames__.

            - Could pursue sponsorship, but happy doing this out of my own time too
        - **Comments** Right now the idea space in terms of fixing US healthcare for gig workers is essentially Aspen Institute "portable benefits" programs which really don't solve the problem they claim to solve or California "turn everyone into full-time employees" fixes that are stuck in the 20th century rather than any real attempt at trying to find something that works.
