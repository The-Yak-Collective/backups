- I'm [Rob Haisfield](<Rob Haisfield.md>), CEO of [behavior design](<behavior design.md>) and [gamification](<gamification.md>) consultancy [Influence Insights](<Influence Insights.md>) and behavioral product strategist at a [startup studio](<startup studio.md>) called [Spark Wave](<Spark Wave.md>), where I do the same thing as I do with my consulting except for portfolio companies.  Generally speaking, this means that I read a lot of behavioral science papers, I play a lot of video games, and I think about how the principles of each apply to the way that apps function.  This is all with the aim of enabling users to better accomplish their goals.
- I got into this world out of a deep passion and curiosity for learning about why people do what they do and a drive to make an impact. Behavior design is a new field, has incredible potential, and still has much to discover.  Gamification has been around for a while, but it has tremendous room for improvement because it's been misapplied and copied in its misapplication since its inception.
- My general mindset is that there is no one theory that explains everything.  The richness of behavioral science and game design is that both have explored a huge amount of different subjects and that the relationships between those subjects are deep.  Habits aren't everything.  Heuristics and biases aren't everything.  Points, badges, and leaderboards aren't everything.  I follow my curiosity unconditionally, and trust that if I keep track of what I learn well, there's a good chance it will be useful at some point.
- I hope to combine my expertise in behavioral science and gamification to help users improve their lives through products. Your users hire you to help them achieve some goal, but loving your product is a result of your teamwork with the user.[++]([The role of the user and the role of the app](<The role of the user and the role of the app.md>)) Both players need to play.
