- Current state of popular speculative fiction seems uninteresting - WestWorld, Devs, Upload
    - They either explore the same dystopian themes of the past  or seem behind the current tech cycle  
- Can we produce better speculative fiction targeted at our client base?
    - Indies have more skin in the game when it comes to technology and the future 
    - Could we produce niche speculative fiction - similar to [Blockchain Man](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/10/10/the-blockchain-man/) and the Yak Collective origin story 
    - It could also be speculative fiction around scenario planning, such as one around this [SalesForce one](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/videos/covid-scenario-planning/)
- End product could be shared with broader community as an entertaining and thought provoking showcase 'here's what we're thinking about'. 
    - Partly inspired by [Astounding](https://www.amazon.com/Astounding-Campbell-Heinlein-Hubbard-Science/dp/006257194X)
    - Partly inspired by the [Five Came Back](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Came-Back-Hollywood-Second/dp/1594204306)
- # Form

    - Each submission has 
        - creator

    - [Alex Dobrenko](<Alex Dobrenko.md>)
    - [Amanda Reeves](<Amanda Reeves.md>)
    - [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>)
    - [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>) >> can help you if you want to publish an ebook, and with editing duties.
    - [Randy Lubin](<Randy Lubin.md>) >> Interested in writing but not sure when I'll have time yet...
    - [Amanda Reeves](<Amanda Reeves.md>) Sounds fun - can help with providing provocations and logics for different possible futures, or contribute a narrative
    - [Thomas Verhagen](<Thomas Verhagen.md>) Very much like this proposal. Just want to flag: while I have a lot of experience writing for corporate decision making purposes I don't have any experience writing fiction.
    - [Jordan Peacock](<Jordan Peacock.md>) - editing, discussion, etc.
    - [Edwin Rager](<Edwin Rager.md>)
    - [Emma Songdahl](<Emma Songdahl.md>) >> I have too many ideas. Ultimately not dystopian, but is the present dystopian or a mixture?
    - [Steve Bryant](<Steve Bryant.md>) >> Available for brainstorming, editing. I enjoy the idea of speculating on future objects—the corporeal nature of a thing makes it more accessible. I also enjoy the idea of speculating on the future of speed (transmission of ideas, rates of change, a la Tofler's Future Shock or the works of Paul Virillo). More difficult to visualize, perhaps, but ultimately more interesting as an exploration of what happens in a hyperconnected world
    - Michael de la Maza
    - [Willem van der Horst](<Willem van der Horst.md>) I'd love to be involved in this if it goes forward. I wrote and presented a Food & Beverage Marketing in the age of COVID-19  trends deck for students this past week, and have ideas of interesting pointers to turn into speculative fiction. I particularly want to dig in synesthesia sensorial experiences from molecular cuisine chefs, and also lexico-gustatory synesthesia, that's one I'm likely to dig into in the near future for this project or something else. That's just one idea, it could be something else. The presentation I gave is here: https://www.icecreamforeveryone.net/iscom-fnb-seminar/

- # Possible Projects 
    - [Sachin Benny](<Sachin Benny.md>) >> The Dialect Reboot - what words and phrases would emerge in post-covid world. Looking back from 2040. 
    - [Michael de la Maza](<Michael de la Maza.md>) >> Ghost story that describes what happens to the superpowers. Maybe based on Charles Dickens.
    - [Christian Bacher](<Christian Bacher.md>) >> A series of quick scenes of ordinary daily life, i.e. walking the dog, commuting on the tube, chatting to parents/siblings on the phone, doing groceries, etc.; as short stories/descriptions of a dialogue, a train of thoughts, oberservations covering not more than 5 minutes of reality.
        - [Chris Neels](<Chris Neels.md>) >> I like this idea! In a similar vein, perhaps a collection of 1-2 paragraph "word sketches" that create an impressionistic take on a future. The reader fills in the blanks.
    - [Reanna Browne](<Reanna Browne.md>) >> Thinking a 'personalised' artefact from the future - e.g. a written (or audio recorded) letter from your/my great great grandchild. A letter/series of letters that encompass the living conditions from (that futures) present, helping the reader imagine, sense, feel, empathise, et al, as well as consider the thread of consequences from today's action and inaction.  
    - [Jakub Polec](<Jakub Polec.md>) >> New mental-models to be adapted based on differentiated assumptions and business changes;
