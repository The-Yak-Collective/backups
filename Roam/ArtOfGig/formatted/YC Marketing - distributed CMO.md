- # Background
    - request for help on establishing a YC Marketing function 
        - from discord announcements channel by [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>)
__Area 2: Developing a proper marketing capability around our assets and members. Ie, keeping track of how our project output is doing, leads coming in, maybe developing marketing assets to land more paid collective projects and leads for gigs for individual members etc. Basically a decenteralized/cooperative CMO type activity.__
    - [Hugo Macedo](<Hugo Macedo.md>) volunteered - initial conversation with [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>)
    - [Matthew Sweet](<Matthew Sweet.md>) that is running the Newsletter wants to be involved
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) also volunteered to join
    - [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>) is interested in creating a “Hire Us” brochure page for the website and trying a short fishing expedition with it in October/November  
    - previous discussions

            - "YC doesn't mitigate risks you don't already have as an indie consultant. What it does do is serve as an amplifier to connect and source back-end brainpower. __Paraphrasing here. - Alex__"
        - "[Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)The hard work of [positioning](<positioning.md>) YC will be working through each of these five categories and creating the appropriate messaging from how we define ideal customer segments, Yak's market category, alternatives to Yak, Yak's unique attributes, and, maybe most interestingly, the value Yak provides."
        - "[Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>) I remember Venkat saying this a few weeks back, that an aspect of YC is that it's centered around an implied sense of taste, and aesthetics. The context here was originally about the dilemma of open source orgs needing a BDFL to operate but I believe it applies equally to [branding](<branding.md>) and [positioning](<positioning.md>)."

- # Objective
    - to create a distributed CMO function shared by several Yaks to elevate YC Marketing capability that fuels its growth
    - What is the Scope?
        - Clients - attract and engage potential clients
            - Client - an executive, a person - we don't engage with companies we engage with individuals, people, executives
        - Yaks - attract and engage new Yaks
            - not a primary scope
            - may overlap with internal comms/coordination
    - What does success looks like?
- # Team
    - Members
        - [Hugo Macedo](<Hugo Macedo.md>) - enabler (better than leader)
        - [Matthew Sweet](<Matthew Sweet.md>) - involved 
        - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) - member
        - [Maier Fenster](<Maier Fenster.md>) - support and connect to [Infrastructure](<Infrastructure.md>) and other YC links 
        - ...
    - Workflows - how the team operates, coordinates and communicates
        - channels & tools
            - `yc-marketing` discord channel 
        - recurring calls
- # Workstreams

all foundational topics related to the value proposition, benefits, barriers, target personas, [branding](<branding.md>), [positioning](<positioning.md>)
    - [Showcase Projects Launch](<Showcase Projects Launch.md>)
how do we launch showcase projects to maximize target visibility and engagement
    - [Marketing Channels](<Marketing Channels.md>)

- ### Random Notes
    - to be edit/comment/upgraded to the main doc
    - Initial random notes from [Hugo Macedo](<Hugo Macedo.md>)
        - Main Challenge:
            - to create a distributed CMO function shared by several Yaks to elevate YC Marketing capability
                - Capabilities
                - Outputs
                - Process
            - Context
                - YC is not the typical product/service/organization - what we create needs to acknowledge and leverage YC culture/idiosyncrasies
                    - YC idiosyncrasies
                        - distributed self-managed organization
                        - many opinions
        - W Framework
            - Why?
                - Context - why it exists?
            - What?
                - What's about?
                - What's the value?
            - How?
                - Channels
                - Processes
        - What is the Scope?
            - Clients - attract and engage potential clients
                - "Client - an executive, a person - we don't engage with companies we engage with individuals, people, executives"
            - Yaks - attract and engage new Yaks
                - not a primary scope
                - may overlap with internal comms/coordination
        - Distributed CMO function
            - Goal
                - be an enabler to create a "unified" view of why, what, how of YC
                - leverages community resources for Marketing - content, showcase projects, contacts
        - Leverage the network
            - Content production/repurpose 
            - Social media - how to leverage the combined power of Yak's social networks (followers)?
            - Contacts - how to leverage the Yak's reference power?
        - Concepts
            - Audience - a lot of Yaks are experienced in building audiences
                - the audience can be a mix of wanna-be-yaks, yaks, and potential clients
                - one of the main objectives of our Marketing is to create the audience
                    - turn Strangers into Friends into Clients
            - Client - an executive, a person - we don't engage with companies we engage with individuals, people, executives
        - Brand Framework
            - Persona
                - How does our target ideal client looks like?

            - Benefits
                - Functional benefit - what's in it for me
                - Emotional benefit - how does it make me feel
                - Social benefit - what positive change it brings to the world
        - Products/Services ideas that leverage YC
            - Explore - sometimes you don't want just 1 answer, but 20 different perspectives that help you understand the landscape, the different opportunities, 
            - Devil's Advocate - hire a consultant and a "devil's advocate" - the most robust plans come from generative confrontation to test resilience, break and rebuild them, stronger.
            - Cross-Pollination/Wildcard - you want expert advice from people that know your industry, your segment - but too much local expertize may come at the expense of focus too much on the past/present and known frameworks. To innovate and disrupt you need cross-pollination with other industries and practices. Join an Expert+Wildcard and explore possibilities with strong industry pillars. 
            - 
        - Questions/challenges
            - Should we have a aligned pitch?
                - consistency is usually seen as a benefit in communication
                - each Yak will have a different view of what is YC
                - how can we benefit of having 20-100-1000 different pitchs?
                - What happens in central communication channels, like the website? We need to have 1 aligned message, right?
            - How do show the potential and build trust?
                - You only see the value once you engage with us
                    - Can we have several levels of engagement?
                    - How can we do a free trial? kind of an initial coffee-shop meeting
                    - What's the WOW moment?
            - What does success looks like?
                - 
            - How do we capture what in Yaks mind right now?
                - Workshop
                - Survey
        - good old SWOT that everyone understands
            - {{[table](<table.md>)}}
                - ^^** Strengths **
^^Diversity - skills, experience, sectors, mind-sets
                    - ^^** Weakness **
^^coordinate effort in a decentralized organization
consistency of message
                - ^^** Opportunities **
^^size and footprint of the network
content from the network
                    - ^^** Threats **^^
Yaks competing for attention
        - Ideas need sorting
            - YC Publication (twitter, blog, podcast, newsletter) - curated content from the YC
                - What if you could gather the combined audience from all Yaks
                - how would curation look like? 
                    - Reddit style?
                    - Board of curators doesn't look like a fit
                    - A Mix to encourage new writers? like Medium does?
                - YC Netflix - a bundle of Yak's content, each Yak is a producer
            - 
        - Marketing Operations Capabilities
            - Copywriting
            - Design
            - Web production - LPs, forms, flows
            - CRM
        - 
        - # ^^Next Steps^^
            - [ ] survey who wants to join the project
            - [ ] build a project plan and overarching framework
