- Welcome to the [Art of Gig](<Art of Gig.md>) community Roam database. The goal is to build a resource that is long-term useful to the gig economy community, starting with immediately useful things related to the [Coronavirus and the Gig Economy](<Coronavirus and the Gig Economy.md>) test
- [Sandbox Page](<Sandbox Page.md>) for people unfamiliar with Roam, and a [Help Database](https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1308)
- Create pages at will, and under the right top-level pages where it makes sense, or make a new top-level page if it makes sense. Cross-link liberally. Don't worry about page titles. They can be easily updated and globally changed, and merged with other pages when there is redundancy.
- Now check out the [Rules and Code of Conduct](<Rules and Code of Conduct.md>) page, then go to the [Index](<Index.md>) page and start exploring, editing etc.
