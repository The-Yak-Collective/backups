- Key Components
    -  Selecting the focus of offering and format
    -  Defining our target audience
    -  Marketing outreach to get critical mass
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) This is too rigid, in my view. The idea was to develop a minimal viable workshop for a lot of different topics. We are not developing a lecture. It is about developing, stress-testing and fine-tuning a format. 
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) The difference between workshop and a lecture is that in a workshop participants talk or practice most of the time. They come to learn something practical and marketable by actually doing it. Not by listening, not by reading, but by doing together with others and instructors in a controlled environment.
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) But at the same time, they can come unprepared, they waste time, they fumble anything they can, everything can go wrong. 
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) There should be a  lot of choreography involved, or you can call it logistics.
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) The focus is to figure out and to perfect the logistics.
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) Just to give you an example. A company I know tried three times to fit a game into 1-hour slot. Which means that there should be introductions, then instructions, then an actual game, then results and takeaways and then a wrap up, at the very least. All three times at the mark of 2 hours they were right in the middle of the game. 
- Ideas on Topics
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)One topic I like actually goes back to Venkat's and Steven Moody (Steven Moody[4481](<4481.md>)) Consultants Diagrams study. He gave us a lecture of sorts.
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) Let's try to make a workshop out of it. Let's see how many of those diagrames participants can master in an hour. If you come, it is you who will be drawing a lot of 2x2s and what's not with the instructors (e. g. Steven's) help.
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)The other idea is to "Take Your Best Shot". What valuable, marketable skill can you teach me in under an hour? Think about it. Everybody can. Take your best shot. 
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) We can then together make a workshop out of it.
    - A few core areas where we can offer in-demand expertise are web branding/media strategy, online learning, multidisciplinary remote collaboration, designing online spaces. [Vinay Débrou](<Vinay Débrou.md>)
    - Something about Creativity, Out-Of-The-Box-Thinking, Collaboration, Community Building. [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)
