    - Don't try to write one single piece of content. Batch write 50 pieces of content
    - The idea of renaming advertising and marketing to "reach and development"

    - Can consulting be open-sourced but still valuable?
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>)
        - There are always proprietary aspects to consulting projects.

- ## From Yak Talk Discord Chat:
- [Mike Morris](<Mike Morris.md>)
    - So, YES to both, but YT can't be both (ever, I suspect). My question would be, "What does the YC need __now__?" and the answer (imho) is the obvious one: A newsletter primarily aimed at the broader public/prospective clients, and (on an ongoing basis, repetituously) answering the questions, 
* "What is this Yak Collective thing?" because right now that's a bit of an enigma
* "What can these people **do** for me?"
* "What have they already done/are they busy doing for others?" i.e. Project successes where we have them
* "Why would I engage with this weird thing?" The ol' 5-point plan. (What's In It For Me?)

Personally I'd __love__ to be part of a "journal of future-casting", but tbh I think this is not the place or time/stage of YC's evolution, and I think these are two different needs/wants.

Geography/audience? Worldwide certainly (otherwise why bother?) and C-suite (because money !)

If most of the current subscribers are already __within__ the YC,... well, maybe that's an audience that wants serving, but does an inward-focussed YakTalk best serve the needs of the YC in its current nascent state? Clearly my own bias is toward something outward-facing rather than internal/informational. But, hey, I'm open to being wrong. :)

    - We can e. g. say that there are 3 (can be more) modules every week. 
One can be a big news about futurecasting that happened this week. 
The other module may have something to do with graphic information. Can we do a picture or a diagram or an illustration every week?

- 9 PDT cadence, release on Friday weekly 
    - whatever has populated in the writing page 
        - 3 most popular pieces? 
        - bullet points for those ? 
    - 3 announcements
        - calls/chats 
        - project releases
    - short & sweet - doing it by hand curating before automation 
    - single paragraph of anyother pertinent info 
- CSV got only has 100 emails 
- [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) And that's the problem. Open rate can be like 25% and click-through rate like 8%. Which means "No Impact", until the list is much longer.
- Right now very limited substack API, so need to send people to substack landing page 
- Newsletter needs to serve two audiences (producer + consumer) 
- [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) Or 2 separate newsletters?
    - including member
    - 10x larger group
    - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) Another way to look at it is: 1) People on YC-Discord; 2) People not on YC-Discord. They may have different information needs. 
- ## Content ideas
    - Theme for every issue, from discussion channels.
        - A digest of channels.
            - Call notes
            - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) There should be something in there that drives engagement.
    - **Emoji react in Discord as a tag for "this could be good for the newsletter"**
    - Ask: Create discord channel as a content dump for newsletter 
    - Integrations between twitter/website/substack
    - Calling out members in the newsletter, highlighting their work as Yaks or as indies
    - List of chats happening for the week, embed calendar in email?
        - All the hosts submit topics a week in advance
    - **What calls-to-action can we include in the email?**
        - What do we want people to do after reading?
            - [Grigori Milov](<Grigori Milov.md>) Keep opening it next week and then next week, etc. Otherwise everything else will just die in the users' inboxes.
            - Call for Volunteers
                - For what tasks, duties, spheres?
                    - Content mods for website
                    - Design tasks
                    - Leading chats
                    - 
- 
- Theme? 
- 
- Needs to serve two audiences:
    - Internal
    - 10x: larger audience, potential clients
