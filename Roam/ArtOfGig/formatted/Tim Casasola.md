- I’m an organizational designer turned product manager.
- Currently, I’m a Product Manager at a product studio in NYC called [Sanctuary Computer.](https://www.sanctuary.computer/)
- Before my PM role, I did large scale org change consulting work at [The Ready](https://theready.com/).
- I do some consulting work around org design, team effectiveness, and experimentation-based ways of working. Some individual coaching, too.
- I’m fascinated by [Conway’s Law](<Conway’s Law.md>): the idea that an organization’s product mirrors its structure. I hope to build on this idea in my writing.
