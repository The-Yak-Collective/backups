    - You are encouraged to explore the map __(click and browse to find interesting potential collaborators to DM). __Here’s a quick overview of the features, objectives and trial use-case of the map: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGf76m7u12jQW0T2tCnbjj4UBSKcywjWi7MR_bWlxB8/edit?usp=sharing
    - Once you have tried it out, Feedback and suggestions are invited in the [yak-network-map](<yak-network-map.md>) discord channel for 1)additional features to make the map more useful for the stated objectives, 2)changes to make it more intuitive to use, and 3)ways to attract a larger base of active yaks to participate.
- **Next Steps**
    - Gather feedback from beta users and evaluate performance on stated objectives via analytics
    - Make relevant updates and release the v1.0 for use and activate rolling participation drive(monthly) for expanding the participant base
    - Integrate the public webpage of the map with the YC website and (optionally) explore possible automation bots.
