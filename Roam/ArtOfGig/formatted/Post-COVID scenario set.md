- **Leads:** [Amanda Reeves](<Amanda Reeves.md>) & [Reanna Browne](<Reanna Browne.md>)- Melbourne-based Futurists
    - Collaborative development of a [morphological scenario generator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243463578_Morphological_prospection_Profiling_the_shapes_of_things_to_come) exploring different possible pathways out of COVID. Essentially this is designing the inner logic of a black box that can produce a range of scenarios based on combinations of different factors. Depending on the number of different spaces we consider and the number of different factor expressions, a large number of distinct scenarios can be produced. 
- # End product
    - A set of scenarios that collaborators are welcome to use as inputs and provocations for their client work.
    - A short Yak Collective deck outlining the approach, include a few sample scenarios, and showcase how collaborators are using the scenarios in their consulting
- # Focal question
    - All scenario sets begin with a focal question to set the scope and time horizon. It is helpful if the question suggests:
        - Who is asking the question? What perspective are we taking?
        - Where is the question located? This might be a place, sector, scale etc.
        - What is included in the question and what is outside of the question?
    - We don't need to find the perfect question, just one that each of us can live with.
    - **Example:** the scenario set we've just developed had a focal question of "What are the possible futures of work and workers in Australia in 2025 as we navigate through COVID?"
    - From the playbook of Hayward: 
    - ## Suggestions for focal question - **add your ideas here**
        - __Our sense is that pathways from COVID is a given, and a 5 year horizon would be as far out as is appropriate to explore at this time. Open to ideas for what other narrowing elements we might consider as a diverse group of international indies__
        - Vast amounts of money are being spent on lockdown mitigations, much being floated as new debt. This suggests to me a debt-drought for the next 5-10 years (longer?) **or/and?** massive inflation and all the ills that go with that. Further, even larger amounts of money are going to be thrown at industries/businesses/cronies as we emerge from the initial pandemic panic (12-24 months from here&now?) trying to put things back to The Way Things Were/Old Tech Stack, exacerbating a capital cash shortage. **But**: my own grasp of matters economic and financial are too shallow to even _begin_ to project implications. I suspect negative knock-on effects for business startup, innovation and research/New Tech Stack, climate-change action, etc. Where does this enormous debt pile-up leave the world in 2025?

    - WHAT is included in the question and what is outside the question?"
    - Also: "we don't need the perfect question. We just need a question that each of us can live with"
    - Suggested focal question: What are the likely futures for 2020 political, economic, and military superpowers in 2025? 
- # What's involved
    - Amanda & Reanna will design and facilitate the scenario development process. Collaborators will:
        - Identify key uncertainties within each of the spaces related to the question
        - Gather insights from different drivers of change, emerging trends and countertrends that relate to the focal question
        - Outline a variety (3-5) of different possible directions each space might unfold based on these insights and uncertainties
        - Stress-test different combinations to check that different combinations produce scenarios with an in-tact internal logic
