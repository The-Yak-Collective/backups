- Designer, [Front-end](<Front-end.md>) Developer & Creative Technologist: ~10 years experience at startups and small companies (including experience managing remote teams). I designed an album cover for Pitbull once ðŸ˜Ž. I've had some success in the "New Media" space: Notably worked on the award-winning interactive documentary "[Welcome to Pine Point](http://pinepoint.nfb.ca/)". Currently working with the National Film Board of Canada to produce an interactive piece about my experience going to clown school, consulting on a few AR projects, and doing a few [Web Design](<Web Design.md>) gigs.

## [Summary: 26th May Brainstorm](<Summary: 26th May Brainstorm.md>)
"i think there is also the possibility of transferring information through other sense pathways. Cyborg nest is working on creating a synthetic sense of orientation through haptic feedback. I am at least aware of some attempts to stimulate nasal pathways electrically (no idea how succesful that really is going to be but they can make you smell random stuff currently).  I think the idea is you can pipe in a random structured signal through any pathway and the brain eventually figures out how to interpret it as sensory input. thats how cochlear implants work (not by emulating normal hearing), how you can give blind people sight through audio pathways, etc" [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)

- "a n = many idea I have been kicking around is the idea of creating a blockchain-based derivative asset that represents an ongoing measurement of "morale". Could also become a more objective version of Gross national happiness (GNH)" [Drew Schorno](<Drew Schorno.md>)
