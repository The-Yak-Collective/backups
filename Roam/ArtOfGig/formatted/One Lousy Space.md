- Brief overview of "Third Space Design"
    - Wikipedia: The third place is the social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home ("first place") and the workplace ("second place"). Examples of third places would be environments such as churches, cafes, clubs, public libraries, bookstores or parks. In his influential book The Great Good Place, Ray Oldenburg (1989, 1991) argues that third places are important for civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and establishing feelings of a sense of place.

        - Main Street
        - The English Pub
        - The French Café
        - The American Tavern
        - Classic Coffeehouses
    - the third space is the place where you are supposed to serendipitously bump into people
- Rich people tend towards compartmentalization of activites into different rooms: the more money you have, the more compartmentalized your space is
    - "the meditation nook", etc
    - "Open concept living" is a trend in the opposite direction: "lets knock down that wall", "lets get rid of these cubicles"
- The premium mediocre millenial approach is to make these spaces semi-public to save costs:
    - a "WeLive" microapartment with a shared kitchen
    - a "WeWork" office with shared conference rooms
    - Starbucks as a shared community third space
        - Starbucks sees themselves as a third space

- Covid cut everyone off from the other nodes of their life, forced to reconsider multiuse spaces
    - future is probably one multi-use private space
- Transforming spaces
    - murphy beds transform a bedroom into a living room
    - tiny homes
- VR and digital "third spaces"
    - chatrooms
    - Discord/4chan (third places are often "spaces to discuss forbidden ideas", leading to revolution)
        - Wikipedia: "Other than the numerous personal benefits third places offer their regulars, Oldenburg advocates for the immense social value they bring and points out their historical role, amongst others:"
