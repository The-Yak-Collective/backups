- ## Yak Collective Aspirations
- Note: It's my belief that a shared purpose will prolong the life of Yak and galvanize it's many brains. This is echoed in community building texts such as __Get Together__ and science fiction text such as Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower(the Earthseed religion, which aims to create a diaspora among the stars), and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, in which Harry Seldon's fictional science "psychohistory" is created to avert a 30,000-year intergalactic dark age.
