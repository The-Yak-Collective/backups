                - how do we use the #[Future Frontiers](<Future Frontiers.md>) to bring fun gigs
                    - 2 extremes
                        - Large corp that think big (Amazon, Tesla)
                        - Startups cash rich - 2nd act - no VC pressure - they can think big
                    - Who?
                        - +VP (signing ability critical)
                        - personally interested in this kind of gigs
                    - Channels
                        - 3rd party channels? probably not now.
                    - Does the content match the target?

            - Should we market a #[Pop-Up Think Tank](<Pop-Up Think Tank.md>)?
            - other product (many 5-6 minimal size, but can also do two yaks)
                - in-depth parallel investigation like #[Yaks do innovation consulting](<Yaks do innovation consulting.md>)
                    - #[Astonishing Stories](<Astonishing Stories.md>) can also fit here 
                - #[Pop-Up Think Tank](<Pop-Up Think Tank.md>)
                    - #[Don’t Waste the Reboot](<Don’t Waste the Reboot.md>)

                    - #[The New Old Home](<The New Old Home.md>)
                    - diverse perspectives is a key benefit

                    - slice-the-pie
                - analyst + insights report, more forward looking and less based on past data collection, yes based on secondary sources. note yaks act as bridges betweenbubbles 
                    - can be based on special knowledge of one yak
                    - can be based on a  group that together has the expertise
                - pair work - one yak does the work, the other brings another perspective,  provides backup, and is less of a risk to the one yak
