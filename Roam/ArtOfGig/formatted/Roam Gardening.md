- # Gardening principles 
    - Pages
        - each page needs to have a
            - [Chief Page Wrangler](<Chief Page Wrangler.md>)
            - a [template/header](<template/header.md>)
        - Anyone can create a page as long they use the [template/header](<template/header.md>) and define a [Chief Page Wrangler](<Chief Page Wrangler.md>)
- ## Roam CC Theme
    - should we choose a CSS theme? What theme brings value to the content experience?

            - Roam is hard enough to get going in that staying with stock seems like a high value.
            - I've tried various themes on my own graphs and so far they've end up borking something :} so I've go back to standard. Happy to have a Yak with better luck do a bit of customizing eg just our own color palette?
- # Gardening Workflow
    - anyone can mark a page or block with [needsupdate](<needsupdate.md>) tag
    - A page that was re-organized is tagged with [gardened](<gardened.md>) 
    - Archive
        - When do we delete/archive a page?
- 
- # Pages/blocks that need gardening
    - {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [needsupdate](<needsupdate.md>) {not: {or:[gardened](<gardened.md>) [Roam Gardening](<Roam Gardening.md>)]}}}}}
