- a tentative project proposal lead by [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>) and potential other contributors
    - looking for contributors with some tangible investment in homestead futures

- project framework:
    - probably could draw a corrolary 2x2 for this project among axes like effort/space/high or low tech/above or below api  
        - let me think on this, homesteading as a larp rather than complete lifestyle commitment ...
        - wwoofing kind of provides this I think, but only where someone already is doing it full-time & can host and then again you don't have ownership of the land per say. timeshare homesteading concept is interesting(edited)
        - you could potentially have a high tech farmhouse
        - smartgrowing crops and things like this
        - urban farming principles could probably laterally transfer in some way
        - urban farming is space and resource conservative whereas high tech farming could be effort and maintenance conservative
        - hydroponics etc.
    - conventional ways to make it work:
        - WWOOF model 
        - subcontract 
        - breadwinner and homesteader  
- notes from discord discussions 
    - [Evangeline Louise](<Evangeline Louise.md>) suggests a distinction between self-sufficiency and self-determinism in homesteads 
        - homestead as largely a legal term
            - something to research further, origins of homesteads 
                - It also occurs to me that things like recent ideas of "friends all have remote jobs then geographically co-locate and rent an office and LARP together as performative federated office building though being decentralized from one another" could also be a sort of self-determinism homestead just on a different social scale - [Shreeda Segan](<Shreeda Segan.md>)
        - artist studio homestead as another radically different iteration of this
            - tools, craft, etc. 
    - Morlock's Escape the City Kickstarter project 
    - Shreeda's curiosity conversations with people have almost all involved people secretly confessing their homestead aspirations to her 
        - a process of "coming out of the closet" 
        - fear of the hard work  
    - [Puja Thiel](<Puja Thiel.md>) had ideas on incremental building
        - lots of it is related to zero-waste but can some of it transfer over to transitioning to new old country living 
- recommended readings
