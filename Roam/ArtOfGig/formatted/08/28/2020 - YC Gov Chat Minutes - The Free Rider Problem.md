        - this seems related in a neat adjacency way: [The 300,00-year case for the 15-hour week](https://www.ft.com/content/8dd71dc3-4566-48e0-a1d9-3e8bd2b3f60f) by [James Suster](<../../James Suster.md>) who has a book coming out on this next month. Grasshopper and the ants. Modern worklife creates a time crunch for non-remunerative work cf Jordan's points re tempo.

        - It's really like parasite load. It's bad if it's an existential risk, but reducing/removing parasites at best is an opportunity cost. At worst there are positive benefits that these parasites provide that you are unaware of that you then lose out on.
        - Another note: people have different tempos. One thing about organization sync is getting everyone on the same "clock". Less formal orgs need to be supportive of multiple "times"; not just time zones, but time intervals. One person's day/week/month may not correspond to another's.
