- Two different ways order will arise in neural technology
    - Order and rules that** emerge** as the number of users grow from 10 to 10,000 to lets say 500 million users by 2040.
    - Hayeks [Spontaneous order ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order)
    - [More is different ](http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf)
    - Order that the state or general public tries to enforce on neural technology in an attempt to make it more **legible **
    - [A big little idea called legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)
    - The collision of these two forces would look like[ Hipster Antitrust or GDPR ](https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/) in Europe? 
    - order that emerges within neural tech community would Cyberpunk/anarchic? 
        - Earlier on it would look similar to the earlier stages of the [bio-hacking communities? ](https://www.amazon.com/Biopunk-Scientists-Hack-Software-Life/dp/1617230022?tag=uuid10-20)
        - At a certain level of users there would be public intellectuals who combine neural tech with other aspects of personal computing/blockchain etc 
        - Public intellectuals who make a "scene" similar to Stewart Brand, Balaji Srinivasan
        - People who are part of the scene would go on to make big Neural tech companies - What would Kernel's place in this order be - Something like Xerox PARC - producing innovations and individuals that define the industry? Something like Intel - being the most important company in Neural tech? 
    - What woud Anti-trust or Privacy concerns for neuraltech look like? Would people be compensated for their neural activity being used as input for other machines (for better spotify recommendations for eg)? 
    - Collision of two emergent forces could create new economies 
    - Collision of the emergent force of neural tech with the idea of legibility?
