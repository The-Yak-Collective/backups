- **INTERSECTING ANGLES:**
    - Tech / infrastructure:
    - Substack; delivery/analytics
    - Discord; comms/curation
    - G.Docs; drafting/editing
    - User / customer needs and experience:
- 
- **Four groups:**
    - 1) Yaks with a weak/passive interest in YC - Aim: ???
    - 2) Non-Yaks with a weak/passive interest in YC - Aim: ???
    - 3) Yaks with a strong/active interest in YC - Aim: ???
    - 4) Non-Yaks with a strong/active interest in YC - Aim: ???
- Ranking?
- ## Business needs and objectives:
    - Yak Collective: 
        - 1) Enhance YC cohesion
        - 2) Inform YC direction (dual sense) 
        - 3) Generate members
        - 4) Convert members to contributors
        - 5) Generate project leads/revenue
- Ranking?
- **EACH GROUP WILL WANT TO KNOW AT LEAST ONE OF FOUR THINGS:**
    - 1) What YC is Doing (events and projects)
    - 2) What YC is Thinking (talk and discussion)
    - 3) What YC is Making (Yak-produced content)
    - 4) What YC is Learning (Yak-recommended content)
- Thus, a clearly marked four-part structure:
    - 1) DOING = summary of current/upcoming events and projects.
    - 2) THINKING = 3 x summaries of most active channels/discussion in past week.
    - 3) MAKING = 3 x links to Yak-produced content, with link to full archive.
    - 4) LEARNING = 3 x links to Yak-recommended content/resources.
- **Additional points:**
    - Possibly sandwiched with intro/outro, though likely extraneous.
    - Titles/headers/sections that de-emphasise text, despite literary-industrial leanings.
    - Structure spectrum: listicle (TF 5 Bullet, A.Kleon 10, JC 3-2-1 vs B.Pickings, B.Smart, Stratchery)
    - Frequency and length are key constraints that decide all else.
- **POSSIBLE ROLES / RESPONSIBILITIES:**
    - 1 x DOING writer. Provide summary of project status / YC trajectory / events.
    - 3 x THINKING writers. Provide summary of most active channel's ideas.
    - 1 x MAKING wrangler. Gather consensus on Yak content and maintain archive.
    - 1 x LEARNING wrangler. Gather consensus on Yak recc'd content and resources.

- **TEMPO / CADENCE:**
    - Weekly...
- **TESTS / ANALYTICS:**
    - ???
- **OTHER NOTICINGS:**
    - Link YC.org to YakTalk SS
    - Lead with title/hook, not date, maybe an issue number?
