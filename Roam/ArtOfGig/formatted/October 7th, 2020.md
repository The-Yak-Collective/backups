                - [Hugo Macedo](<Hugo Macedo.md>) comments:
                    - In fact, the more I’m involved and experience YC from the inside the more I believe we have to discover the core from the inside. 
“Who are we?” - I thought it was an identity question for the outside. But I now realize that is not solved for the inside (Yaks)
And if we don’t know who we are, we can’t define how we want to be known/perceived to the outside world. 
This means that we need to give priority to Yak Marketing vs. YC Marketing. 

- who are we?
- why should I care?
- cater different personas 
- define the yak journey and yak success

`Positioning discussion thought-starter phrase: work-as-play. It’d be great if we can strongly tie YC to that concept. Cf “sufficiently advanced work is indistinguishable from play” — Seb Paquet`
            - Positioning YC will be hard with so many diverse perspectives - what's the best way to embrace and distill (?) this diversity?
