        - You can always get the current agenda in the Discord channel using the command **$agendalist**. You can add items using the command **$agendaadd** with item details in the channel. Today's main agenda is to spend the first 10 minutes reading/browsing key reference pages on the Curiosity rover for 10 minutes, then an open-ended discussion:
            - Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)
            - Nasa mission page: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html
            - Video found by Victor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaUhLXolGaI
        - I've created a section for Curiosity in the References page with these links. Please dump anything else interesting you find there. Feel free to create other reference sections. We'll organize better once we have more.
        - We will also spend some time discussing how to use Twitter to do light-weight self-documentation of the project.
