- **status:** working draft, aimed at provoking ideas and give a starting point for how a collaboration could happen on short notice (mostly written by [Darren Kong](<../Darren Kong.md>))
    - related page: [Self-Employed life starter pack](<../Self-Employed life starter pack.md>)
- informal collaboration/engagement model that is understood (e.g.[handshake deal protocol in angel investing](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/) or frieNDA) and a standard set of agreements that allow us to execute on said protocol
- Pricing/Proposal
    - Two models for pricing
        - 1. contractor bills client at full rates (of subcontractors) and takes a % of billings as commission
        - 2. contractor pays the subcontractor full rates and takes their cut directly before paying out subcontractors. 
    - % Commissions
        - Engagement Manager 
        - Lead Referral (when the Lead /= Engagement Manager)
        - __prob tiered? based on $ or project type & duration__
            - $1k-5k, $5-10k, $10-20k, $20-40k, $40-80k, $80-160k...  ? 
            - another parameter is # of consultants staffed
        - Note from [Benjamin P Taylor - London](<../Benjamin P Taylor - London.md>)
            - BTW for the future of the Yak Collective, there seems to be a strong set of boundaries for network-based consultancies around an income split which is 10-20% operational / capital overheads, 50-70% paid to individual consultants, 5-20% for profit and the rest for sales/leads/network etc. I've never seen a network consultancy work outside those bounds, though YC is of course not that yet and could be something different entirely.
    - subcontractor price sheet should be made available for reference
        - each consultant shares a range of rates (retail "normal" rate + a lower bound "subcontract" discount)
            - should we agree on hourly just to keep it easy? hourly, short-term, and hourly long-term? 
    - lead or engagement manager (if separate) will choose how to price / propose and resource the consulting engagement.
        - resourcing may include a chat with the partners + a brief and open call for bids in a discord channel? 
        - the engagement manager/lead will strive to meet consultants at their retail rate if possible. 
        - if rates are lower than expected, they give the option to the consultant to take or find a new subcontractor.
    - price internal/admin tasks as part of engagement (e.g. engagement manager hours or a separate operations line item)
- Sample Set of Agreements 
    - __(need better samples)__ 
        - NDA
            - https://nondisclosureagreement.com/independent-contractor.html  (needs to be edited for subcontractor)
            - Here's a unilateral NDA that I used wtih a consultant. Obviously, IANAL, etc, etc

        - subcontract
            - https://www.pandadoc.com/subcontractor-agreement-template/
    - https://avokaado.com/ - A tool to draft contracts "code-review" style.
- Considerations
    - resourcing may be an area where we'll find issues â€” we need subcontractors to be upfront about what is great, okay, and bad fit within an engagement.
    - how can we be resilient if an engagement isn't working well ? 
    - what happens if a client doesn't pay?
    - what happens if a client is severely delayed in paying?
        - lead/engagement managers are paid only upon chasing down receivables.
    - will need to consider IP on a case-by-case basis. or will everyone agree that we assume we assign any IP to client (work for hire) ?
