- I’ve finally began to niche down and landed where my passion lies...working with social startups/nonprofits. I focus primarily on message clarity, audience engagement, and fundraising. Wile the consulting aspect is dominant, I definitely take on a more “done with you” style with clients. I like to get my hands dirty due to my marketing background. I absolutely love what I do.
