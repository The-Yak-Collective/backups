having a concrete list of things that you care about that you can refer back to can make certain paths suddenly obvious, and others clearly wrong or a waste a time.  [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>)

- Assuming that at least some >0 percentage of claims about tech company ignorance towards particular gendered issues (such as safety and privacy in social networks) are well-founded, does their persistence and repeated occurrence suggest more that a) companies are ignorant of the issues, or that b) companies are aware of the issues but do not care sufficiently to address them ?or i guess c) companies are aware and want to act but end up hiring grift and thus not getting the results they want [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>)

which i'm totally convinced - if every tech team hired a gender and/or critical race theory expert (not a "culture warrior" but someone who thoroughly understands the theory and what it means and what its limitations are) all sorts of gender and race problems in tech would disappear. a consistent pattern of amazement amongst the women-in-tech circles I follow on Twitter is how Twitter consistently fails to solve its nazi/asshole men problem, when the fix is blatantly obvious to anyone who understands how gender (in the gender-theory sense) and tech intersect - [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>)

- **Surface Your Uncertainty**: Don't be afraid to ask questions about content or context, or to offer half-baked ideas to see if they are fully bakeable, or to sound out opinions on whether something makes sense. Whenever I've done so I've found people have been polite and generous and helpful, encouraging me when I get things right and gently nudging me in the right direction when I get things wrong. It's been a great strategy for me to explore what I know and what I do not know (and also, what I think I know that I actually don't know), and to learn things from that.

- i am not a consultant, but i am coming to view it as outsourced outside-of-the-box thinking, provided as a service for organisations that are structured by and with and through inside-the-box-thinking (which is necessary for them to operate smoothly, predictably, and with consistent culture/ritual). - [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>)

- running a successful business is about finding a success and then reproducing that success as often as possible with as little effort as possible. the kind of environment necessary to do this is not likely to foster highly independent thought or independent thinkers. but sometimes, you need independent thought (for example, to understand __why__ your success was a success, or to suggest new __kinds__ of things you might be able to build from your first success). enter, consulting - [Damian Stewart](<Damian Stewart.md>)
