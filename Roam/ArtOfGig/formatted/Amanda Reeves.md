- Use scenarios in your consulting work? I build morphological scenario generators (essentially a black box that produces scenarios based on combinations of different factors - kind of like a slot machine wheel). Depending on design, it can produce hundreds of distinct future scenarios to be used as inputs and provocations for your client work.If you'd like a custom black box built, drop me a line [Amanda Reeves](<Amanda Reeves.md>)
