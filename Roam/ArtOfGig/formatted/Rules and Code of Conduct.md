- This is a publicly editable Roam db for now, and currently only shared with paid subscribers of [Art of Gig](<Art of Gig.md>) or anyone who follows a link to it from the public Discord. It will eventually be shared with the whole list once there is some useful content on here.
- At some point if it gets too messy we will switch to publicly readable and editing rights by invite/request only.
- We'll figure out rules as we go along, but for now there are only 2 rules. 
    - The improv rule of [Yes, And](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...).
    - The [Don't Make Us Make A Rule](<Don't Make Us Make A Rule.md>) rule
- Email any questions to [Venkatesh Rao](<Venkatesh Rao.md>).
