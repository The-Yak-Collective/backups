- ## Making the next normal better than the last one
- The inaugural report by the Yak Collective, __Don't Waste the Reboot__ offers organizations a smorgasbord of 25 creative and unexpected provocations, ideas, and action frameworks to navigate the Covid-19 crisis. Authored by 21 diverse contributors from around the world -- most of whom are working together for the first time -- we believe this report will get you thinking about your reboot efforts in a bolder, more imaginative way. Let us know what you think!
