- **Role play principles for CLIENT role**
    1. Assume you've already decided to trust your sparring partner (you've hired them after all)
    2. Get your head in the "problem" or "situation" and try to suspend all meta-cognition on the sparring process. That's what you're paying THEM for.
    3. Basically play it as "thinking out loud" -- think as you naturally would on your own, except aloud. Follow the contours of the problem where they lead you.
    4. Play "suspended high status" -- you're the boss, but you're bracketing this interaction as occurring outside of status games
    5. Let them "manage" the conversation, but don't feel bound by it. Step in to steer decisively if you feel they're drifting down unproductive paths. You own the car, they're just driving it.
    6. Assume there are things you don't know (or don't know you know) that will be revealed through conversation, and will surprise you. Be open to that.
    7. Take short live notes if you want, but no more than mnemonic phrases. Not detailed.
- **Role-play session principles for CONSULTANT role**
    1. Treat your list of 10 favorite models as a NEGATIVE priming -- trot it out if actually relevant, but watch out for your own force-fitting tendencies
    2. Assume your client is a VP+ who has basic execution down, don't go there unless there is insight at the execution level or they want to
    3. You're driving, but they're deciding where to go. Get attuned enough to be inside their OODA loop and start going where they want to go before they know it.
    4. 80% improv yes, and, 20% probe weak spots. Pick your battles. Complement what they're trying to do. If they're testing a structuring of the problem, you could try stressing their structure or populating it. If they're brainstorming, you can try adding the structure.
    5. Avoid all provocations into "win/loss" debates... senior execs are sometimes addicted to "winning" sparring. Not the point, don't enable it, don't encourage it.
    6. Assume you'll learn at least as much as the client, and likely more, even though you're getting paid.
    7. Do NOT take notes. You're going to try and reconstruct the conversation entirely from memory later in your notes email.
- **Immediate Debrief/Reflection questions**
    1. CONSULTANT: How good were the guesses on where to go?
    2. CLIENT: How good were the guesses on where to go?
    3. CONSULTANT: Were there any aha moments?
    4. CLIENT: Were there any aha moments?
    5. CONSULTANT: Was the "fit" good or bad?
    6. CLIENT: Was the "fit" good or bad?
    7. For CONSULTANT: What style did your sparring session gravitate to from your end?
        - CROW
        - RAT
        - GOAT
    8. For CLIENT: What posture did you end up adopting?
        - Thinking out loud
        - Seeking advice
        - Trying to explain
        - ...
- **Post-mortem debrief/reflection**
    - How well did the notes email match your recollection of the conversation?
- **Logistics**
    - Bill by the hour (call + time to compile notes).
        - A 60m call may result in 120m compiling notes.
    - Go deep, with 60-90m calls
        - Execs spend so much time in 5-10m time boxes. Let them have the chance to engage intellectually, to go deep.
    - Instead of a regular call schedule, consider scheduling based on the client's readiness. You can set expectations that clients keep track of what they want to talk about, and that they should reach out when they have enough for a 60-90m call.
    - Advertise for this service through __appreciative__ __long-form__ writing/content, not __technical how-to__ stuff. This is one slow-marketing way it has worked, but other ways may be possible.
- ## **Suggested Framework for Sparring Practice Call – Abbreviated Version**
- By [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)
- **Who This Is For:** New consultants looking to get their feet wet, and working consultants looking to add a new type of arrow to their quiver.
- **Parameters:** 40 minutes, one-on-one, via Zoom
- **Before the call:** Each participant should exchange info with regards to each other's typical client, and what problems that client might have. 
- The reason for this is that a marketing consultant is (probably) not going to have anything interesting to offer an executive who needs a complete strategy for digital transformation. A consultant who excels at teaching executives presentation skills may not be effective recommending management reforms.
- Each participant should come to the call having picked a client problem. Do not tell the other participant what client problem you picked.
- **On the call:** Each participant gets 15 minutes in each role. After both have gone, spend 10 minutes debriefing.
