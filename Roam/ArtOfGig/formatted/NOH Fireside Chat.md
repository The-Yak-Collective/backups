- ## **Insights**
- **Keep your points bite-sized**
    - [Nita Baum](<Nita Baum.md>): "we do a lot of "bite-sized" experiential tastes of our work"
        - It's important not to go into "nerd-mode" and go super granular, boring the h*ck out of your audience in the process. Keep it high-level, fun, interesting, and quick. Pick the best bites from the deck.
- **Brainstorm a series of prompts.** Break up the panel and discussion and go round-robin, or take 3-5 answers if group is large.
- **Schedule social time of 10-15 min before the call** for open-ended "coffee talk" and for folks to naturally discover commonalities(see Scott Allen's "Discover Multiplexity point below)
- **Tell stories**
    - Offer vulnerability when telling stories. What was the biggest problem/turning point/resolution you faced in creating the NOH project?
- **Tell your audience what to do at the end of the chat**
    - Should they...
        - Sign up for newsletter, sign up to become Yak, buy Yakcoin, keep following the project at XYZ?

- From [Scott Allen](<Scott Allen.md>):
    - From an article I've done on virtual trust-building, here are some of the elements, many of which could be implemented in an online offsite context:
        - **Discover Multiplexity**
            - You know how when you meet someone for the first time, and you start discovering that you have a couple of things in common, it’s like, “Small world!” You discover four or five things in common, and it becomes “What a coincidence!” Get to 10, and you start cracking jokes about being twins separated at birth! This is known as multiplexity, or simply, how much do you have in common? Social media is great for discovering multiplexity. All you have to do is read their social profiles and their last few posts, and you’ll undoubtedly find some common ground. Be sure to post as much as you’re willing to on your own profiles to help others do the same with you.
        - **Be Vulnerable**
            - People give trust when they receive trust. Be willing to put yourself out there. Open the kimono. Share something that stretches you beyond your comfort zone. You being open creates a safe place for them to be open, and that creates a bonding experience.
        - **Make (and Keep) Microcommitments**
            - If you say you’re going to like their post, like their post. Tell them you’re going to read and comment on their blog, and then do it. Forward those LinkedIn connection requests in a timely manner. Set an appointment for a call with them and keep it—be right on time for it. Each little bit of promise and fulfillment builds trust and rapport.
        - **Be Proactive**
            - Don’t wait for them to ask you—take the initiative. People really do notice and appreciate social media interaction. Likes are good; shares are better; comments are best. Make introductions to relevant and interesting people.
        - **Collaborate**
            - There is perhaps no better builder of relationships than working together on (and preferably achieving) a common goal. And there’s no shortage of opportunities to do this online: petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, virtual summits, joint ventures, etc. Seek those out, and if you can’t find them, create your own.
        - **Put in the Time**
            - Building strong relationships takes time. Sure, sometimes people are drawn together instantly as a result of some major emotional event—usually a traumatic one—but as an intentional strategy, you have to invest the time. That may mean having a private, one-on-one conversation, or reading and commenting on their blog posts, or giving them feedback on something before they send it out. Time may be the one resource that’s in truly scarce supply, so you want to choose wisely how you spend your time, but that’s also why people appreciate it so much.
