- Thoughts / Questions from [Tom Critchlow](<Tom Critchlow.md>)
    - I think I've done a fair amount of sparring previously for clients. For example:
        - $5k / month for a weekly phone call. Client lasted 2 years
        - $7k / month for a weekly phone call + periodic on-site workshops and meetings. Client lasted 18months.
    - These engagements felt like **sparring** - they are focused on helping the client with __ways of seeing__ - i.e better mental models for their organization, their projects and their industry.
    - ^^However the only work I've done like this **started with a more hands-on engagement** and **then transitioned into a sparring engagement**.^^
    - Most of my work is **capacity-building** not **problem-solving**. Does this fundamentally set me up poorly for sparring work? Is sparring geared towards problem solving?
        - __Background on capacity-building vs problem-solving here: https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/[consultant-as-capacity-builder__](<consultant-as-capacity-builder__.md>)
    - Questions:
        - I don't typically have clients approach me directly for sparring - instead they are often seeking more hands-on work. **How do you attract clients for sparring specifically?**
        - When a client comes to you with a problem - **how do you sidestep solving the problem directly and instead offer your sparring services?**
        - All of my sparring engagements have long periods of in-activity or idle-ness where less thinking is needed and my point of contact is off managing operations. This works when we have a previous trusted relationship in place but I'm guessing will be harder to stomach for a new working relationship? **How do you charge for sparring consulting? Retainer? Hours? Other?**
        - In my sparring-consulting I think I've been very effective since I have worked more closely with the organization previously - gaining tons of context and situational awareness for the company.** How do you run effective sparring without this previous context?**
- Questions/Thoughts from [Sachin Benny](<Sachin Benny.md>)
    - I've not done any sparring where I was paid. I have played the role of sparring partner with a few start-up founders I've worked with. Mostly introducing them to frameworks they are not familiar with or by virtue of not being directly affected by the problem they are solving 
    - Most of my gig work has been contract product marketing work - either building marketing capacity or solving a specific problem. Very little sparring and I've not been happy with the quality of clients either - **how does one go about meeting clients that I want to work with?**
    - **What are some beginner steps in going from contractor to consultant?**
- Questions from [Ben Mosior](<Ben Mosior.md>)
    - Beginning to offer sparring… does advertising sparring as a service = failure?(Is “success” generating enough attention / pull for sparring through your writing / media / etc. WITHOUT explicit advertising?)

- Question from [Vaughn Tan](<Vaughn Tan.md>)
    - Can you elaborate more on "appreciative" when you say "appreciative writing?
- Questions from [Christian Bacher](<Christian Bacher.md>)
    - To my surprise I am often approached not by clients/customers but by colleagues/business partners explicitly for "sparring" their rough concepts on business models or process design. Here my question & confusion: **How does sparring differentiate from coaching**, applying coaching techniques like the ones that NLP offers?
