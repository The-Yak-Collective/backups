    - **[Intended audience](<Intended audience.md>):**
        - **[Who](<Who.md>):**
            - Option 1: early stage founders
                - **[Value for them](<Value for them.md>):**
                    - Realizing that and how they can take advantage of consultants
                        - in particular use them instead of hiring certain talents that cannot be found, fed, satisfied or used
                        - in particular, instead of looking for co-founder, look for partnership with a indie-consulting collective which acts as **a flexible brain** 
                        - cofounders are units vs. YC is a fragmentation of brains
                        - consultants act as brain (processing ideas) less as workforce (building product)
                        - consultants should act as accelerators (inwards of company) and leverage (outward of company), not as exchange (consultant should create ability and sustainability =  teach more than they learn)
                    - Understanding that the value of a consultant depends on the difference between cost of lack of expertise and difficult of onboarding 
            - Option 2: Department / Division / Brand leads in enterprise-scale organisations [Mike Baxter](<Mike Baxter.md>)
                - **[Value for them](<Value for them.md>):**
                    - more control and autonomy
                        - Big-3 consultancy firms are usually very expensive and hence are budgeted and managed centrally
                        - A lower cost, more agile delivery mechanism could put consultancy within reach of department, division, territory or brand managers
        - **[Questions to be answered by deliverable](<Questions to be answered by deliverable.md>):**
            - contrast- what is not this concept
            - what problems should be related to this concept (what issues should recall this concept) = examples of a few common business problems that should be related to this concept
            - how the YC can provide this concept
        - **[Value for YC](<Value for YC.md>):**
            - yaks are eminently suitable for ESSU because they are flexible and do not need a lot of runway to deliver the MLCC (minimal life-changing consulting)
            - help prospective clients figure out what they can get form working with YC

            - next step - choose a don't waste the report slide and build a deliverable from it
                - choose a concept
                - get permission
                - draft something, at least the contrast

            - We were talking about viable old-fashioned journalism opportunity?

            - My suggestion is: we have the power to call out new controversial perspectives.
            - MVP Recommendation: find companies which are already going against the grain.
            - Scalability: take the approach, generalise and take to potential clients
        - Comments (Rafael) - Specifically, I was envisioning a short article regarding investigating organizations that are already pursuing alternative strategies to traditional consulting perspective. I consider the traditional consulting perspective to be central command and control. I think in the Reboot deck, they explain this in some examples.
