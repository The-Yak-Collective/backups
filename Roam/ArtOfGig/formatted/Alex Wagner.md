- **Idea:** save search for ["remote gig"](https://twitter.com/search?q=remote%20gig&src=typed_query) on twitter. Might be noisy, might be fortuitous. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- **Posted 3/12/20:** Last tweet from 3/15. [Thread of gigs available](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1238141681075195906) from [levels.io](https://twitter.com/levelsio) account. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- business-metaphysical country doctor-ing. maybe "maker of unknown-unknowns into known-unknowns" - [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- All organizations operate with some level of dysfunction. Essentially, a consultant helps organizations become more efficient. There are numerous ways to do this but it seems to come to improving: processes, communication, and decision-making within the org. - [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- When they have a problem they don't know how to solve. When the individual or company is in a sufficient amount of pain to act and hire a consultant. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- Here's a hypothetical six-step process, typed from memory: [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- For the "ur-text" here, see Alan Weiss' [Million Dollar Referrals](https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Referrals-Perpetual-Seven-Figure/dp/0071769277). Don't be put off by the title – it is very good. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- It would be cool for someone to lead a regular weekly chat based on QOTW. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- Jay Abraham may be best known for his "Strategy of Preeminence" model for attracting clients and navigating relationships with them. It fully defines being "client-focused" as a strategic mindset. AFAIC, should be required reading for service providers and consultants, especially with regards to business ethics. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- Most freelancers, creatives, non-business people get triggered by the thought of asking for referrals. Creating effective strategy, doing sales call, etc, asking for referrals is an art. This book will help you grow your consulting practice more efficiently, and faster than you might otherwise. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)

- Teams that trust each other do great work and are the definition of "head-in-the-game". Covey's book gives a compelling thesis that trust is the core currency in business. [Alex Wagner](<Alex Wagner.md>)
