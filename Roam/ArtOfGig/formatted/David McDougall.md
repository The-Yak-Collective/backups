- related to Venkat's point about identity and "do vs be," I think that teams need this mix of skills to succeed, because working in new areas often requires deep insight in one area (eg technology) in order to apply it in other areas that you understand functionally. An individual with such a skill set is valuable, but a high-performing team with one is even better. How can we talk about what it takes to constitute those teams, and what it looks like to do so, and how to know which areas require what levels of depth? It usually starts with an *insight* that straddles a deep knowledge and a useful knowledge. - [David McDougall](<David McDougall.md>)

- one thing I would be especially conscious of, in terms of [positioning](<positioning.md>) and sales but also the work itself, it that you should be solving your clients’ problems first and foremost, and using the toolbox in order to solve those problems. One doesn’t hire a guy with wrenches, one hires a plumber aka a guy who fixes pipes. So do be sure to have a problem-centric frame. Don’t sell me your grass seed, sell me my lawn [David McDougall](<David McDougall.md>)
