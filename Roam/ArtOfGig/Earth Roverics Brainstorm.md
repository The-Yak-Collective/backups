- What are existing examples of Earth rovers
    - Various underwater exploration vehicles
    - Weather balloons, weather drones
      
    - tags/sensors on wild animals?
- Differences between Earth and Mars rovers
    - You can go where the rover goes
        - Scout rovers... for humans

    - Watching things change or grow (earth specific mostly)
        - Long-duration change
        - Time-lapse photography
- User interaction with rovers
    - How do you report
        - Default "system normal" reporting
        - Default predicted change reporting
        - Anomalous reporting
            - Risk
            - Wonder
        - 1000 things going on -- what to focus on?
    - Rover follows you and takes direction on what to pay attention
        - Machine learning interesting stuff
            - What you attend to
            - What you indicate as interesting
    - "Change watching" vs. roving
        - Generic novelty seeking circuit
        - "Here's a rock, here's a cat, here's blue rock" ... "blue rocks are interesting"
    - Re-enchantment as function of rover 
        - Rovers have aesthetics.... ?
            - Develop a sense of taste based on themselves and their humans
        - Form factor effects... it should show you its world/wonder
        - Tree-climbing rover... monkey POV
        - "What is it like to be a monkey"?
            - Is it enchanting to have the monkey bot or is the monkey bot perspective enchanting
            - What is it like to be a bat https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/study/ugmodules/humananimalstudies/lectures/32/nagel_bat.pdf
            - Granny weatherwax example
            - Doc Ock
        - How do I see the world from POV of a rover
            - Particular rover
            - Eg: lead in shoes
            - Rover tells stories
                - Simple camera not that interesting
                - "Narrative compression" by rover itself
                - "Automatic narration" 
                - Sensory augmentation -- Moon Ribas earthquake
                - Rick and Morty eg. Harmon story circle
                - Implanted sensors to feel what the rover is feeling
        - Remote control cars -- Victor video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp2cvPROfSg&t=70s
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis
        - Debugging as a separate interaction mode
- Thought starter questions
- What are some domains on Earth that are suitable for roving
    - Obvious wildernesses -- forests, deserts, poles, mountains, ocean surface, ocean depths, atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena (example hurricanes)
    - Built environment with wilderness aspects -- junkyards, industrial sites, sewage systems
    - Apparently civilized domains that are wild to some form factors
        - Domestic environment (routine for adult humans, roving environment for pets, babies, robots)
            - "Locations from which your house looks interesting"
        - Offices
        - Streets/sidewalks

- Conceptual aspects of earth roving
    - Scale/perspective limitations
    - What is the output of rovers/roving, especially if the rover is looking at which unstructured reality
    - Static vs. dynamic missions
        - Exploring leaves/grass vs. chasing cats
        - Roving as an opportunistic second-order function
            - % of attention to roving
            - 1% slack time (like 20% time at 3M/Google)
    - Deer keep eating fruit trees (criminal deer)
    - Crime-watch sidewalk delivery robots
    - Mapping in space/time ... when/where events and anomalous events
    - Rovers vs. computers
        - Computers are on a very different faster time scale
        - Rovers are on a human time scale
        - Embodiment
        - Computers don't sleep
        - Rovers... do sleep? Depends on level of maintenance etc
- Neuro relations
    - DMN https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network
    - Task positive network --- sometimes you do want the rover to do tasks for me
        - haul things, etc
- What makes a robot an earth rover as opposed to a service robot (like food delivery or butler or manufacturing)?
    - not so much destination as a domain
      
    - observing, analyzing
- What can you assume on earth that you can't assume on Mars or Moon
  
    - weather changes
    - animals & other life
- What are commercial applications if any
- What would an "earth exploration" program look like, and how might it differ from a space program?
