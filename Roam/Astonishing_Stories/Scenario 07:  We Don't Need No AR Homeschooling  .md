- ## Describe this scenario
    - Homeschool pods are the norm now, coordinated on a mass scale with hype-personalized quantification, augmented reality networks, and gamified parenting & child education monitoring and feedback apps, including bio/neuro-feedback. Young teenagers "rebel" and escape from this at night when alone in their bedrooms with identity stickers they bought and shared from the illegal AR forums (which is similar to a combination of 4-chan, the Dark Web and TikTok in our present, but in augmented reality) which covering their own fingerprints with new ones allow them to play with hijacked, stolen or deep fake identities in gangs which troll, vandalize, or protest public, commercial and educational AR spaces and the quantified homeschooling pod system with tagging, hacking, and other illegal actions. 
- **What tensions, paradoxes, challenges exist in this world?**
    - Tensions: Inter-generational AR Struggle: Don't Trust Anyone 12 to 21 years old
    - Paradoxes: the more effective and efficient the quantification feedback loop is, the more resistance it causes, leading to increasing decoupling of the loop from reality
    - Challenges: Controlling the illegal AR forums. Fighting and/or manipulating the AR trolling. Winning the Hearts And Minds of the young generation
- ## What year is this scenario set in?
    - 2070
- ## How does it feel to live in this time?
    - The AR Kids Are Not Alright
- ## Who wins in this future? Who loses?
    - Private cybersecurity companies needed to police the new AR and homeschooling spaces win. Politicians promising a crackdown on AR youth criminality & illegal AR forums win. Families, students, companies, communities etc. which can't afford this extra security lose out in education, peace, business etc. Youth ultimately win with the discrediting of gamified & quantified homeschooling /parenting systems.
- ## How did we get from here to there?
    - Pandemics and accelerating global warming accelerated these trends
- ## How do people talk about the choices we made in 2020?
    - They don't. That period of history isn't part of the curriculum or public memory.
- ## What keeps you up at night?
    - Pandemics and global warming risks
