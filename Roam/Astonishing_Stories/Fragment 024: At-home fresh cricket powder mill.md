- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[growth]] future [[a decade]] from now, there is an [[brochure]] related to [[insects]] that creates a feeling of [[fascination]].
- Fragment:: 
    - A brochure for an at-home fresh cricket powder mill. An all-in-one kitchen appliance that you drop food scraps into to feed your cricket farm. When fully grown, it roasts them fresh, and grinds them into a fine nutritiously dense, high-protein powder for use in baking. Mini bread-baking oven attachment optional.
