- what if a pixel in an nft comes alive 
    - advanced form of nft where each pixel changes according to some form of computation
    - then instead of obeying the rules it disobeys them but why would it change that, cause its function is to maximize the value 
    - so it tries to maximize the value of the each pixel - and they kind of act as one - like a bird that changes formations - like the murmurings 
    - would it be motivated by external factors - like would it be thinking about value of other nfts or the mathematical problem 
    - what would it optimize for if anything 
    - what if it obeyed the same mechanics of starling murmurations 
    - pixelated version of murmurations
    - could be from perspective of an artist
