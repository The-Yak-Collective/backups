- In a [[growth]] future [[a century]] from now, there is an [[implant]] related to [[drones]] that creates a feeling of [[charm]].
- A century from now implants mischievously coordinate with other implants to create more implants. They develop sentient consciousness that evolves into a meta-borg that narcissistically meditates on its navel. This creates a feeling of charm as they contemplate the infinite regression.
