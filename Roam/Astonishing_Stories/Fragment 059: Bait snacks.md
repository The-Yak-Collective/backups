- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[collapse]] future [[a century]] from now, there is a [[snack]] related to [[pets]] that creates a feeling of [[awkwardness]].
- Fragment:: 
    - Traditional models of domesticated pet ownership no longer make sense, so the new model is the return of an old one - coax or collect a young creature and train it to hunt with you. Certain snacks are manufactured to serve as optimal bait for such creatures - moreish and laced with a mild sedative.
