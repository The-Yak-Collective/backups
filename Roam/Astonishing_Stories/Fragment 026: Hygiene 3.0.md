- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[discipline]] future [[a decade]] from now, there is an [[social culture]] related to [[hygiene]] that creates a feeling of [[alienation]].
- Fragment:: 
    - A post-pandemic hygiene 3.0 world, where people across all different types of relationships touch each other far less and generally keep a higher level of distance between one another. Personalised biotechnology continues to develop at a rapid rate as triggered by the pandemic, to serve the purpose of maintaining personal health/hygience. Social norms of a disciplinary nature develop around this.
