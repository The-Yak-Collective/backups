- # Directions for developing flash fiction
    - 300-500 word flash speculative fiction using Future Fragments and Scenarios
    - ## Use the MICE framework
        - **Milieu** -  The setting/location is the main part of the story and the character is trying to escape it. Eg: Indiana Jones, Dune
        - **Inquiry** - Character is trying to answer a question. Eg: Imitation game(how to decode German codes?)
        - **Character** - Character is deeply dissatisfied with his life internally. Eg: Coming off age stories, Into the Wild.
        - **Even**t - Character is trying to re-establish status quo or stability after an external event has happened. Eg: John Wick,
        - Short fiction should have 1-2 elements of MICE.

        - ## Story
            - Have a maximum of 2 characters, and only one setting/location for your story
            - ### Title:
            - **First 3 sentences**
            - **Who - What action are they taking**
            - **Where - Sensory detail **
            - **Genre - Specific + Unique **
            - **The future fragments can be used anywhere in the above three **
                - He looked down in pain at his [programmable forearm tattoo](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/6jX2RXOls) after finishing his last note. The microbots in his arm etched a new web of nodes mirroring his note taking system on Roam. His mind had become a mess since his father’s death and now it was reflected on his arm for all to see. “How can I possibly untangle this mess” he thought to himself.
            - **Try-Fail cycle - How has the character tried and failed to resolve the conflict (5-7 sentences)**
                - He had tried everything, even subscribing to the [“Love the Land” program](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/b0JBkV_8Q) sponsored by the state. The people from the LLE (Love the land enforcement) had taken away all his electronic devices and internet connected implants and put him on a homestead 150 miles west of Austin in the West Texas desert. There, every evening he looked at the wind turbines lined across the entire horizon and wondered when his mind would cease to become an endless loop of the same thoughts going round and round.
            - **What is the character trying now to resolve the conflict**
            - **Use -**
            - **Yes, But - **character does something which works, but something bad happens too
            - **No, and - **character does something which does not work, and something bad happens
                - Now, he was swiping through the Perfect Father app that his friend had suggested as something he could try. He eventually ended up hiring an older man with a slightly disappointed resting face as his father. Rather than this being a sado-masochistic experience, it so happened that Mr.Vader, the man he hired to be his father is actually a pretty decent indie-life coach. Mr.Vader introduced him to the concept of “reparenting”. The act of imagining being a parent to your younger self, the way you would have liked to be parented and coached. He had always thought of himself as the son who never lived upto his father’s expectations but oddly enough Mr.Vader had made him realize that this aggrandizing, hypercritical inner self that he had acquired during his formal years was kind of a drag. But, now he was angry at his dead father.
            - **What is the next thing that they try (this should solve the problem)**
            - **Yes, and - **character does something which works, and something else good happens
            - **No, but -  **character does something which does not work, but still something good happens
            - **This part is harder, you are changing modes to conflict resolution. **
                - He decided to feed the memories from his[ iRemember](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/1uBQxh_pw) account that collected artefacts from his life and his own Roam notes to GPT-51 which accurately represented his father, except for the occasional off hand complement which he hated. He found yelling and getting extremely angry at GPT-51 to be surprisingly cathartic, kind of like an escape room experience but for relationships.
            - **Ending should mirror the beginning, a shift has happened - something has shifted, making it clear what has shifted **
                - **Who**
                - **Where**
                - **Genre**
                - Today, he was browsing through the App Store and found that GTP-51 PREFAB FATHER was not the top selling app this month. He looked down at his forearm tattoo, which right now resembled the beautiful constellations he observed on that dreadful Love the Land escapade, and thought “Who knew you could be rich from your trauma”
            - __Above format in MICE is -  event(death of father)-character(childhood trauma)__
    - ## Artwork suggestions
        - Provide guidelines/stock images or cartoons to clearly communicate this to the artist and make their work easier
