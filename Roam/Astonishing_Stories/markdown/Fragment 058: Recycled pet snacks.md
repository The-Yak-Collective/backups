- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[collapse]] future [[a century]] from now, there is a [[snack]] related to [[pets]] that creates a feeling of [[awkwardness]].
- Fragment:: 
    - To limit the resources required to keep a pet alive the law is that you can't keep them for very long. Since resources are scarce there is a service that tries to reduce the awkwardness of 'recycling' them into snacks. There are parenting guides on how to talk to your kids about 'pets.'
