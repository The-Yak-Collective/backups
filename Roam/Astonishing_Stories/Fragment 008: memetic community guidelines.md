- In a [[growth]] future [[two generations]] from now, there is a [[law]] related to [[cloning]] that creates a feeling of [[hilarity]].
- Virtual spaces allow anyone to connect with anyone about anything. You can find your weird tribe. Communities need to have good guidelines and policies. No one has time to write that from scratch though. Instead they keep taking copies of different communities online. Creating a huge phylogenetic trees that circle in on each other (along with attack vectors). The hardest and most volatile part of any communities guidelines are about acceptable jokes and memes. They are also the most abused.
