- **[Scenario](<Scenario.md>):** 
    - In a [collapse](<collapse.md>) future [a century](<a century.md>) from now, there is a [snack](<snack.md>) related to [pets](<pets.md>) that creates a feeling of [awkwardness](<awkwardness.md>).
- **[Fragment](<Fragment.md>):** 
    - To limit the resources required to keep a pet alive the law is that you can't keep them for very long. Since resources are scarce there is a service that tries to reduce the awkwardness of 'recycling' them into snacks. There are parenting guides on how to talk to your kids about 'pets.'
