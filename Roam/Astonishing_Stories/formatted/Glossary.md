- # [Sprint 1: Future Fragments](<Sprint 1: Future Fragments.md>)
    - "A future fragment is a glimpse of a possible future, focused on an object that might be found within it. The future fragments created for this project were produced by playing The Thing From The Future."
- # [Pockets of the future in the present](<Pockets of the future in the present.md>)
    - "To anchor these future fragments, we are looking for pockets of each future that is visible in the present."
    - "Pockets of the future are weak signals of the future fragment described. This can take many forms: a technology prototype, an op-ed, a counter-trend, a discovery. It might be found in a similar or related terrain, or it may borrow inspiration from similar patterns in distant spaces."
- # [Sprint 2: Scenarios](<Sprint 2: Scenarios.md>)
    - "To set the scene for the speculative fiction to be produced through this project, we are bringing together different combinations of [Sprint 1: Future Fragments](<Sprint 1: Future Fragments.md>) and building on these to create juicy, more fully developed visions of different futures containing more nuanced overlays, tensions, and collisions between these fragments that the speculative fiction can explore and extrapolate. "
- # The Thing From The Future
    - [The Thing From the Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/) is an imaginative game that challenges players to describe objects from a range of alternative futures.
    - Each prompt from The Thing From the Future follows this structure:
        - In a [Arc](<Arc.md>) future [Time scales](<Time scales.md>) from now, there is an [Object](<Object.md>) related to [Terrain](<Terrain.md>) that creates a feeling of [Mood](<Mood.md>).
    - ## [Arc](<Arc.md>)
        - "**Arc** outlines the type of future world that the thing comes from, and how far away it is from today. There are four types of arc, each an umbrella for countless possible scenarios."
        - ### [growth](<growth.md>)
            - "**Growth** scenarios tell a story that continues on with the historical trajectory of ever-increasing growth and development - think bigger technology, more densely crowded cities, increased wealth creation. "
        - ### [collapse](<collapse.md>)
            - "**Collapse **scenarios are built around a major disruption to social order, and society can no longer function in the way it has been accustomed to. Collapse might be triggered by a variety of catalysts: economic instability, environmental overload, moral degradation, civil war, natural disaster, and of course pandemic."
        - ### [discipline](<discipline.md>)
            - "**Discipline** futures focus on societies adopting different fundamental values from the present. Living according to these new values often involves refraining from behaviours that are normalised in the present. The shift in fundamental values are often driven by a return to ancient or traditional beliefs, the creation of a new philosophy or ideology, reconnection to the natural world, or a God-given doctrine."
        - ### [transformation](<transformation.md>)
            - "**Transformation** futures are a complete paradigm-shift, much like the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly. They follow a historic change from which emerges a new way of understanding the world and our place in it. These scenarios tend to be driven by either the adoption of advanced technologies, or the widespread development of a higher state of consciousness and new understanding of the world."
    - ## [Time scales](<Time scales.md>)
        - [a few years](<a few years.md>)
        - [a decade](<a decade.md>)
        - [a generation](<a generation.md>)
        - [two generations](<two generations.md>)
        - [a century](<a century.md>)
    - ## [Terrain](<Terrain.md>)
        - "**Terrain** is the thematic context or location where this object could be found in that future."
    - ## [Object](<Object.md>)
        - "**Object** is the focus for your imagination: a specific cultural artifact that reveals something about how this future is different from today."
    - ## [Mood](<Mood.md>)
        - "**Mood** suggests how it might feel to experience this thing from the future."
