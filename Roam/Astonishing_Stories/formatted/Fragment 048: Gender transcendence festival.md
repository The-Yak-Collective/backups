- **Scenario: **
    - In a [growth](<growth.md>) future [a generation](<a generation.md>) from now, there is a [festival](<festival.md>) related to [gender](<gender.md>) that creates a feeling of [melodrama](<melodrama.md>).
- **[Fragment](<Fragment.md>):** 
    - In a generation from now there is a new festival that pops ups on to the scene which only allows people  in that do not see themselves as having a gender. They see this as a new movement outside of the LGBTQ+ movement and will not even allow people who identify as non-binary in. Obviously this creates some friction between the too groups which is played out like a soap opera on social media.
