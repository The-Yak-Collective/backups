- **Scenario:** 
    - In a [growth](<growth.md>) future [two generations](<two generations.md>) from now, there is a [pill](<pill.md>) related to [learning](<learning.md>) that creates a feeling of [optimism](<optimism.md>).
- **[Fragment](<Fragment.md>):** 
    - R&D in nootropics pays-off once researchers are able to test dose response & chemical composition on an individual basis through eye tracking and game-based evaluations ("Cognition as a Service"). Most of the developed world readily has access to these "performance-enhancing drugs", which become culturally normalized (by contrast, espresso machines are considered "low-class").
