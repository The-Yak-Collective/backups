        - a kit of hyper personalized learning tools based on quantified activity from the previous year. This could be subjects, training for specific activities etc. coincides with increase in homescholling
    - [Fragment 026: Hygiene 3.0](<Fragment 026: Hygiene 3.0.md>)
        - A post-pandemic hygiene 3.0 world, where people across all different types of relationships touch each other far less and generally keep a higher level of distance between one another. Personalised biotechnology continues to develop at a rapid rate as triggered by the pandemic, to serve the purpose of maintaining personal health/hygience. Social norms of a disciplinary nature develop around this.

        - "A clarinet children have to use during national examinations to earn highly prestigious grade certifications. There's no examination proctor. Passing/failing exam is entirely judged by a machine learning system baked into the instrument that calculates their score by comparing the student's performance to other children taking in that same year."
- ## Describe this scenario
    - [Collision Forces](<Collision Forces.md>)
    - Homeschooling becomes the educational norm by way of law around public health but homeschooling has slowly been transformed by highly-tailored learning programmes created for students, meaning very high levels of attainment for most children. Every child owns an ML Testing Clarinet that they must use to demonstrate their musical ability - the best performers are rewarded with being able to interact with one another under strict hygiene regulations. 
    - ## What tensions, paradoxes, challenges exist in this world?
        - The intellectual advancement that comes with a more precise and effective form of homeschooling versus the partial alienation of homeschooling, which has been mandated by law for public health purposes. Note partial here because technology now allows a level of interaction with peers that was not possible before the age of computing. An interesting challenge here is the idea of play in this type of future. How will children replace playing with one another, an important form of development, in a hyperpersonalised home schooled hygiene 3.0 world? 
        - What happens to the children with a low scores from their ML Testing Clarinet? 
        - As the fundamental aspect of society - educating the population - be
        - ## What year is this scenario set in?

        - ## How did we get from here to there?
            - Recurrent pandemics, advancement in delivery of education/computerised education & the desire to try and maintain the human connections that help spur great music/art
