        - "The Dunning-Kruger supplement is what you take right after you start to realize that you don't know what you are talking about. Even though there are more errors that happen, we realized that they were not as bad as being stuck in old ways of thinking. Truth-sayers use the supplement to stop themselves from being dragged down by the dominant logic of old models."
    - [Fragment 003: Cis-gender festival](<Fragment 003: Cis-gender festival.md>)
        - "A festival that pops up for celebrating cis genders from a fringe group. Some accuse it as regressive while others think it is a right to celebrate one's identity."

        - "In the future there is a new online platform called the  111 channel this is where the 1% of the 1% of the 1% come together to flaunt their wealth and show what new "things they have come up with to do with their unlimited stockpiles of cash. The new aspect to the channel is that to be able to view the channel you need to be in th 1%  to interact on the channel you you need to be in the 1% of the 1% and to create content for the channel you need to be in the 1% of the 1% of the 1%.

    - [Fragment 008: memetic community guidelines](<Fragment 008: memetic community guidelines.md>)
        - "Virtual spaces allow anyone to connect with anyone about anything. You can find your weird tribe. Communities need to have good guidelines and policies. No one has time to write that from scratch though. Instead they keep taking copies of different communities online. Creating a huge phylogenetic trees that circle in on each other (along with attack vectors). The hardest and most volatile part of any communities guidelines are about acceptable jokes and memes. They are also the most abused."
    - [Fragment 009: Performance-enhancing memory drug](<Fragment 009: Performance-enhancing memory drug.md>)
        - "Post-Covid, biotech gains renewed interest and financial backing that begins to pay off a decade or two later. Mid-century nootropics are becoming very effective at improving memory and restfulness, and propelling some American, Chinese, and Indian pharmaceutical companies into the stratosphere. Norms are changing around even brain drugs that exist today. A breakthrough in 2049 regarding a drug eerily similar to nicotine appears to slow and reverse the effects of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain diseases, which has become a societal focus especially in  rapidly aging societies like Japan and Europe. Entrepreneurs, grad students, and other rule-breakers get their hands on it already on the very early suggestion that it cuts sleep requirements in half and vastly improves shortterm memory. Longitudinal studies, though, take time- the drug remains out of reach for most non-infirm people."
    - [Fragment 010: Infinity & beyond](<Fragment 010: Infinity & beyond.md>)
        - "A century from now implants mischievously coordinate with other implants to create more implants. They develop sentient consciousness that evolves into a meta-borg that narcissistically meditates on its navel. This creates a feeling of charm as they contemplate the infinite regression."

        - ""Love The Land" - A return to simpler times, this federal campaign advertises the joys of simple life - work the land and grow your own crops, disconnect from technology. Some  take this earnestly and reconnect to growing their own food, others take it as permission to make love on the land, creating delightful 60's era 'make love' communes."

    - [Fragment 050: WhoSampledWho](<Fragment 050: WhoSampledWho.md>)
        - "WhoSampled is a very old game. If you are unfamiliar with it, it is somewhat similar to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon skipping from one piece of music to another according to who included samples of what. Due to causality, the chain generally goes backward in time, until it grounds out in the earliest recorded music."
    - [Fragment 051: Deliberately vague clauses](<Fragment 051: Deliberately vague clauses.md>)
        - "Series of new laws written by regulators who find the whole notion of cloning improprietous from the start lead to laws that try to talk around the issue altogether to avoid giving anybody any ideas, e.g. "A person may not dispense a DNA sample to a third party in relation to any financial transaction without a clear statement of intent and suitable delineation of future plans related to said sample." Everybody else finds this hilarious, and it ultimately affects nothing."
    - [Fragment 052: Sensory augmentation](<Fragment 052: Sensory augmentation.md>)
        - "Drugs that temporarily augment your senses (e.g., enable you to perceive the UV spectrum or have a heightened sensitivity to electrical currents or magnetic fields) are cleared for use by the general public, albeit under strict supervision. Sensory palaces pop up to provide said supervision, and let an imbiber play around with their new senses and understanding the theory behind the phenomenon."
    - [Fragment 053: Jumpsuit officewear](<Fragment 053: Jumpsuit officewear.md>)
        - "Jumpsuits suitable for mechanical work replace hoodies as the understated officewear of choice among middle-to-top-tier tech workers. This is ostensibly the result of the continued comingling of software with a diversity of physical engineering disciplines, but think pieces written by observers of the phenomenon seem to accurately note its being rooted more in the desire to not be in front of a laptop than the actual time spent on mechanical engineering. (Physical work as a luxury)"
    - [Fragment 054: Simulated forest fires](<Fragment 054: Simulated forest fires.md>)
        - "Forest fires have burned down major parts of all national parks in the US. Hikers now wear a neural link that simulates the smell, touch and look of a forest. When the user returns to the basecamp they have to go through a cleaning process to remove all the ash and dirt from their body, which reminds them of the time when forests were real"
    - [Fragment 055: Stem cell delivery](<Fragment 055: Stem cell delivery.md>)
        - "Small under-skin implants of synthetic stem cells are able to stimulate the body to break down failing organs and regrow healthy ones in their place.

    - [Fragment 056: Simpatico drone](<Fragment 056: Simpatico drone.md>)
        - "neural API that helps you be simpatico with your drone which does most of the work for you, it can have the same mood or it can have complimentary moods"
    - [Fragment 057: Drone love](<Fragment 057: Drone love.md>)
        - "In the year 2120, as the world is more and more interconnected but less populous overall due to declining fertility, people can feel close to one another even in a long distance relationships with an ocular/brain implant that controls a drone next to your loved one. When not actively controlling the drone, AI can maintain continuity."
    - [Fragment 058: Recycled pet snacks](<Fragment 058: Recycled pet snacks.md>)
        - "To limit the resources required to keep a pet alive the law is that you can't keep them for very long. Since resources are scarce there is a service that tries to reduce the awkwardness of 'recycling' them into snacks. There are parenting guides on how to talk to your kids about 'pets.'"
    - [Fragment 059: Bait snacks](<Fragment 059: Bait snacks.md>)
        - "Traditional models of domesticated pet ownership no longer make sense, so the new model is the return of an old one - coax or collect a young creature and train it to hunt with you. Certain snacks are manufactured to serve as optimal bait for such creatures - moreish and laced with a mild sedative."
    - [Fragment 060: Groovy intergalactic drones](<Fragment 060: Groovy intergalactic drones.md>)
        - "Intergalactic humanlike drones can now explore the expanses of space and time - they can go anywhere at nearly the speed of light. It's groovy. Implants are now released that allow humans, from the comforts of their home-pods, to control the drone and experience life as if they are the drone. Given the infinite expanse, it becomes difficult but not impossible to find someone else inhabiting a drone with their implant. When you do, its magic - a feeling of charm and perhaps even romance can come over you. What a thrill."
    - [Fragment 061: Grandparent Tracker](<Fragment 061: Grandparent Tracker.md>)
        - rYn8AnYFC 
    - [Fragment 062: Live/Work Containers for Knowledge Miners](<Fragment 062: Live/Work Containers for Knowledge Miners.md>)
        - Tiny houses turn into workspaces, provided by corporations in lieu of office space cum Aeron Chairs. By 2030, sensory bubbles will be sprinkled across the planet. The built environment will be optimized for sustainable productivity. McMindfulness baked deeply into the manufactured space's sensors, advancing beyond current AppleWatch's prompts for exercise, breathing, Pomodoro bursts with breaks. Controlled temperature, sound buffering, light modulation. CBT/DBT skill building integrated into the workflow, to facilitate emotional self-regulation. Challenges, akin to a zoo keeper's need to enrich captive animals with cognitive and physical demands that simulate a virtual hunt for food. Eventually, Universal Basic Housing would reference these tiny places as a common good, giving everyone wifi, consumer grade VR, Netflix. In return for the bed & circuses, Mechanical Turk-ish tasks, as well as e-sports competition and media experimentation, can flow back to the welfare of the entire society.
        - What year is this scenario set in? 2030
            - ## 2020 -- most of the pieces are already here, they're just unevenly distributed and patchwork
                - 
        - ## How does it feel to live in this time?
            - Snug as a bug in a github
            - Hygiene is a very high order value, motivating the envelope's barriers to entering
            - Secure seclusion, modulated by cybernetic loops that offset isolation by algorithmic reminders to (virtually) connect
        - Who wins in this future? 
            - Productive knowledge miners, who enjoy super-optimizing their workflow
            - The skilled workers in fly over spaces
            - The otaku + a range of phobics: agoraphobes, OCD germophobes, 
            - Knock-on benefits for the homeless, as society recognizes how to mass-produce the vital ingredients of basic modular housing
            - 
        - ## Who loses?
            - Any population that's not physiologically able to adjust to VR won't fully participate in the social compromise: the blind, those sensitive to vertigo, perhaps other conditions that also come to be seen as allergic 
            - Architects and many support fields for building, maintaining, and modifying homes and offices will yield ground to mass-production. 
            - Owners of real estate in high rent districts, as well as many of the ancillary supporters of current urban co-working arrangements
            - Workers who depend on studio environments with a high degree of social collision and serendipity. Also, social parasites will need to shift from f2f grifting, networking, brainpicking, and the whole crowd of scene-crashing spammers
            - 
        - ## How did we get from here to there?
            - The co-viral vector accelerates all flattening of social distance, as we substitute "safe" social intercourse and displace hand-shaking, f2f interactions
            - McMindfulness is based on evidence (CBT/DBT). It is adequately well-specified to be taught as skills via chatbots rather than high-priced priests of psychotherapeutics
            - Sensor-informed prompts already tick the box of quantified-self desiderata: exercise tracking, reminders to stand up, prompts to breathe, passive recording of sleep regularity & quality.  When sensors can compile and compare data from the surrounding environment and its impact on individuals' physical and psychological data 
            - Architecting intrinsic challenges have begun to be incorporated in special built environments for geriatric and neurodiverse populations.
            - Containerized / Tiny Homes are a trend. Science fictional dystopias (Snowcrash, Ready Player One) 
        - ## How do people talk about the choices we made in 2020?
            - Probably akin to the Depression era development of electrification. It will seem inconceivable how people endured the mess once almost everyone integrated via fiber linkup.
            - Our previous (pre-2020) habits and intercourse will evoke as much disgust and mystification as our inability to grasp how our recent ancestors rarely showered
        - ## What keeps you up at night?
            - When we live on bits as circuses, the grid and internet will need to be hardened. Any aggressive attack on our work cum entertainment feed would disable most cognitive sinks. Boredom rather than starvation would be the lever of the 21st century siege warfare. Many would choose Soylent instead of fresh and varied food if that could preserve our distraction and social connection supply.
            - This transition will be as epochal as Robin Hanson's dichotomy between foragers and farmers. The third epoch will be the news-feeders, informavores who thrive in an abstracted social space.
