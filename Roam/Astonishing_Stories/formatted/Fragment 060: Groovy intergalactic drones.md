- **[Scenario](<Scenario.md>):** 
    - In a [growth](<growth.md>) future [a century](<a century.md>) from now, there is a [implant](<implant.md>) related to [drones](<drones.md>) that creates a feeling of [charm](<charm.md>).
- **[Fragment](<Fragment.md>):** 
    - Intergalactic humanlike drones can now explore the expanses of space and time - they can go anywhere at nearly the speed of light. It's groovy. Implants are now released that allow humans, from the comforts of their home-pods, to control the drone and experience life as if they are the drone. Given the infinite expanse, it becomes difficult but not impossible to find someone else inhabiting a drone with their implant. When you do, its magic - a feeling of charm and perhaps even romance can come over you. What a thrill.
