- Scenario:: 
    - In a [[transformation]] future [[a generation]] from now, there is an [[instrument]] related to [[family]] that creates a feeling of [[anxiety]].
- Fragment:: 
    - A clarinet children have to use during national examinations to earn highly prestigious grade certifications. There's no examination proctor. Passing/failing exam is entirely judged by a machine learning system baked into the instrument that calculates their score by comparing the student's performance to other children taking in that same year.
